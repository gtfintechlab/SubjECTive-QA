"Okay. And with relates to kind of the next wave of MoCA and beyond, multi-room DVR, it seems like MoCA as a technology really cornered the market here in the US But kind of the IP delivery side, I guess there is kind of other technologies that have started taking off, it's WiFi et cetera. I mean, what needs to happen or what and when it needs to happen, do you think that MoCA really starts going into that next phase?","I think that this is specifically in the over the top video delivery service market so as multiple components in the third wave of growth. The first one is kind of the over the top opportunity, the second one is the move of traditional pay TV service providers from the current video delivery mechanism, the modern IP-based video delivery, and then the third components are really international. So, on the over the top feeds, I think you are seeing WiFi as being kind of the predominant technology out there today. We are really in the early adopter market for that part of the business and I think the focus right now in over the top pay TV service providers is first and foremost to get their application embedded in as many consumer electronic products is possible. So if you look at the Netflix streaming service as an example, they are now in PS3, they are in Xbox 360, they're now even in Wii. Vizio [ph] announced at CES that they are now in most of the major branded TV manufactures, with the exception I think of Panasonic and Sony. So that's kind of the first and foremost objective is given in as many platforms as possible. The second thing that they are focused on is to get the consumer to at least use the service once. And as it turns out, if you include WiFi as opposed to just including an Ethernet jack, the attach rate of people actually trying the service at least once is about 2X. So, WiFi definitely provides that immediate benefit of saying, okay, somebody is going to try the service, at least use it and see how it goes. The disadvantage of WiFi is really going to be evidenced as you start moving through the mainstream part of the market where the quality expectations of video are basically set, and the bar is set by their current incumbent pay-TV service providers. So, just start having more streaming sports content and more things where people have a quality viewing experience get us back on the use of services, unless you have a high quality FatPipe that delivers the video quality very reliably. I think that's going to take a couple of years and that's when MoCA really starts to get additional traction. We did start having initial conversations with TV set manufactures. These are obviously confidential customer discussions, so I can't mention customer names, but where TV set manufacturers are starting to come to us about plans to embed MoCA in TV sets over time. In a similar timeframe, we see the potential of incumbent pay-TV service providers like DIRECTV with our view moving to more of the same client architecture which also has the potential to push MoCA into TV sets, and also in a similar timeframe like in Northern Europe, where there is coax infrastructure and Europe will really lag the US in both DVR and HDTV deployment by a couple of years. We see an opportunity for MoCA to deploy there. So we see multiple things happening that drive that with the biggest factor being this IP video distribution and the need for quality of service.","1assistant

"I just had 2 questions. One is, what is your assumption for the second half with regard to the ticket size? Do you expect further improvement there?","Well, we look for our ticket to continue to trend positively, it has now really for a number of quarters.

"Okay. Fair enough. And finally, just a quick one. Your press release mentioned the FIN 48 and accretion of tax liability. Could you explain whatâ€™s driving that or what the issue is around it?","Sure. Itâ€™s actually with FIN 48 you are required to essentially analyze your tax reserves and has to be based on technical merits is to whether or not you can have something in your tax return that is separate from most on your financial statements. Based on that review, we essentially took our deferred tax liability, and if you look at the balance sheet, you essentially have that liability that was emplaced at May 31 and that has been broken down to the deferred tax asset and the accrued liabilities mainly in the long-term accrued liabilities, you will see that of the flip side portion of that come through essentially. And there was a $14 million additional reserve that we established through retained earnings, which is really based on the competition on technical merits of FIN 48. And so, I think when you go through that merit, you will see that that is essentially just a move from that deferred tax liability as of May 31 up until.","2assistant

"Thank you. Your comments on the liso-cel PDUFA extension reflected no real concern whatsoever. And it's one of the four new launches you called out for this year. It seems you are completely comfortable with the FDA meeting the regulatory timeline. I just want to make sure that that's the impression you wish to convey to us? And then secondly, it was stated that the COVID-19 could lead to inventory destock and a drop in patient visits to infusion centers in the second quarter as well as beyond that. I'm just curious, what was the decline in these metrics during the month of April? Thank you.","And just on the question around the stocking that we saw. So as we entered the pandemic situation in February and March, what we saw was across the board, we saw safety stocks increasing so we saw wholesalers, making sure they had increased inventory. We also saw that pharmacies had extra safety stock. And then we installed with patients getting longer scripts, as we talked about it. Revlimid was an example doubling the number of days that they could get. We are starting to see some of that destocking come out. And we anticipate, as I said earlier that the majority of that will come out in Q2. So of the $500 million that we talked about, majority of that come out in Q2, and then we'll see it coming out to in Q3 remainder is what we're anticipating. As far as what we're seeing on the new patient started early days. What we're seeing there, but we did see some of those new Rxs declining 10% to 20%, depending upon them. And we'll be watching that very closely in the second quarter, and we'll update you on that. And then on the infusion center, similar, that we're seeing in that 10% to 20% range as well, fewer patients. So again, that's something that we're going to keep an eye on in the second quarter as well. Chris, I don't know, if there's anything that you wanted to add to that.","2assistant

"One last on the Power/Vac, the transfer out of Iowa.

How does that compare at this point in time?","We completed moving all of the operations out of the GE facility around the end of February.

"Yes, thanks. I wanted to start off by digging into the Americas' results a little bit more. I mean, I guess, it sounds like you're putting some of the blame on development plans on behalf of your customers, going to EVs, autonomous. I guess, I feel like Europe is going through similar product changes over there, yet demand has been somewhat more consistent. So is it a difference in time lines? And more importantly, what's your visibility additional clarity on how long this impact might last?","Yes. Greg, thatâ€™s a good question. Definitely the Americas is challenging. We thought we'd see improvement through the quarter and we are not seeing that through the third quarter. Europe â€“ the difference between the Americas and the Europe is: Europe, we have some programs that are going on that are helping to feed the pipeline; whereas, in the Americas, we were at the end of some programs at the end of last year and the newer programs really just started picking up and it keeping delayed from quarter-to-quarter.","2assistant

"The second question, and either you or maybe Peter can take this, sticking with the commodity price inflation but asking more from a working cap standpoint. Can you quantify how much of a headwind you expect it to be to your 2018 results? And if lumber prices were sitting where they're at today, next year how much of a potential tailwind could you see to working cap from the lower commodity prices?","It's a good question. I think that maybe the best way to characterize it is that at the peak we were seeing pretty substantial increases in both accounts receivable and inventories from the impact of inflation. I think that when we were looking at it in the third quarter, it was still probably $100 million to $150 million range of headwind that we were still burning through. We think we'll burn off a good chunk of that by year-end, sort of in line with the way that we generally would pull down accounts receivable and inventory. I don't really have a number for you off the top of my head for next year's cash flow results, but I think it's fair to say that we would see it as a tailwind. Again, to Chad's comments, so it's a little early to count any chickens on that just because of the volatility we've seen.","1assistant

"And then just two other quick ones. For you Chris, and I will just quickly ask them then you can answer. For you Chris, just I want to make sure I understand the free cash flow generation that you are looking for â€˜15 and â€˜16 and then how much you will be offsetting by VCC spending. And really where I am going with this is I am trying to understand what your usable free cash flow or available free cash flow is for other activities over the next two years and your capital allocation sort of objectives what that is. And then I don't know if I missed this but the whole blood revenues that you are actually expecting for fiscal â€˜15 and how much share repurchase is actually incorporated into your guidance.","Thatâ€™s all right. So in terms of the plan and the guidance we provided, weâ€™ve made an assumption about how much of the share buyback we would get after this year. Of course, weâ€™re going to have pricing grid and weâ€™re going to buy at some prices and not others. So you have to make a somewhat arbitrary assumption about that, for I think conservatively we said $50 million of share buyback. Other than that, our capital allocation policy is pretty clear, acquisitions, service debt, buyback shares. And weâ€™ve told you what we think we will commit to buying back shares and we will get after it at an appropriate rate as market conditions permit.","1assistant

"Hi, good morning everyone. So just one question for me and I think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about some inflation in cost of goods sold. So maybe Steve, could you just give us kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of what commodity costs and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently in the context of -- seems like freight costs are going up, you've had some competitors talk about, coco prices going up. So just trying to get an understanding of directionally, where inflation is headed right now.","Sure. Yeah, for us, I'd say overall, it's been relatively stable, so on the commodity side, relatively stable. You saw big movements in commodities across Q2 and Q3 and of course, we've talked in the past, we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program and I would say today they are fairly stable.
There are increases in freight costs. There too, our teams do a great job of longer-term contracting, which helps to mitigate some of that increase, so that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing costs and part of that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen.
So we call that out in the prepared remarks. But in total, sitting at this point, I would say overall COGS is fairly stable and we'll give more guidance on 2021 when we get into the fourth quarter call.","2assistant

"I wanted to come back to the inventory and the work that youâ€™ve done on the global side, and the differences between China and the rest of the world, and where you are in terms of reading that, and how we can think about that going forward in terms of maybe even not talking about price declines moderating, but prices starting to stabilize and maybe improve.",Iâ€™m not sure I follow your question.

But is it fair to say that U.S. retail mid single-digit profit growth maybe you are going to be a little bit below that. But it could be made up for by stronger International and Convenience Stores or are you maintaining the segment guidance for the year?,"Yeah, Rob, I think it is fair to say thereâ€™s going to be probably a mix shift if you look at how the year started for us. We said weâ€™re going to be down in the first quarter. We were -- we're actually on the bottom line working materially of our own internal plan. But we did have some favorable results in Convenience and Foodservice and International offset by some weaker than planned results in USRO.

"I just have one quick question. Everything has been asked and answered. You made a reference in the prepared remarks about Pirate's Booty is tracking ahead of your strategic plans. Can you talk about what are the key learnings that you've developed through your years as the CEO that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and implemented, what are your key learnings and what do you take forward to future learnings -- the future acquisitions?","Well, so I think a lot of learnings along the way. I guess I would start with, there is a business model for brands that that we as a company are best with and that is branded items, where brand matters, where the business has significant scale probably close to that $100 million mark and it needs to be a business that has a high gross margin, because that's what our business model is. We're a branded company, we invest a lot in marketing and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow, invest and grow. And we -- that's our model. That's what we need. So I think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset.
I think secondly, really understanding the strength of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dives on which KPIs, we think predict the ability for a brand to scale.
And then, I would say really trying to scale the business well and I would say, hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way, as you know in the past, we bought some businesses that were too small, we bought some businesses that had lower margins and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well and I think we've done a very focused effort on the scaling as well and we've gotten much better at that, relative to supply chain, relative to the talent that we need, when we buy a company like this, where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit, we want to keep people who know the brand and the business.
But we also have to be focused on the point that we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. So I mean, I go back to the scale, the branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones and then picking the right underlying KPIs that say it's a sustainable business, because if we can do that, we can make it home.

"Okay, great. And then final question on BOT. Would leasing be part of this whole BOT, or is this -- we're talking about apples and oranges, you're just looking at different business models, one's leasing and one's BOT, right?
","I see it as separate models. It's vague. There's people argue, it's part of the BOT model. But I see it as an expansion of that, if you will. Leasing is going to be more fixed payment-driven as opposed to tied to performance at the site. So in my world, I would see this slightly different but the same general idea.

"And a questions from Mr. Carey, you know you talked about retooling your businesses for a digital world, and its seems like there is a, maybe itâ€™s not a new business, but it tweak to the existing industry practice thatâ€™s makes a lot sense to me, I just love to get your reaction, your affiliate fees are all charged on a per household basis, which makes it expensive for peoples who live alone to watch Television relative to families. It also sort of exposes you to piracy as you go down this authentication model, where people could sort of share passwords with one another, why wouldnâ€™t be industry sort of move to an affiliate fee per connected device and sort of make TV more affordable for singles and extract more money from families with five TVs and three iPads and also sort of limit the piracy risk from this authentication model thatâ€™s emerging?","Well, I guess two different questions. I mean, I think on a per device range, I think actually in some degree, I mean like DirecTV that you do have, we donâ€™t as a channel provider, but you take DirecTV, I think that you have a per device, because you need a set top box, so they can charge, so they can change you 5 or 6 bucks for, and I think actually cable guys, now they are moving to digital unless to an analog you just plug it in. They can call it a box fee or something, but there is an incremental â€“ there is an increment at the consumer level for whether you have one, two, three or four TVs hooked up.","2assistant

" Got it. And on the second half order outlook, you said that memory would be up half-over-half. Do you think that's weighted more toward DRAM or NAND?"," I think in September, right now it looks like it's -- NAND is a higher percentage. We're -- right now, for September, we're forecasting memory overall to be about 27% of the mix or so, 27%, 28%. And NAND will be the bulk of that. I think there is -- but there is investment in both areas. And so -- I just don't have the detail on December but that outlook is for September right now.","1assistant

"Yes, thanks. Two follow-ups. First of all, as you look at the DIRECTV MoCA deployment, will that have similar lag as Verizon, meaning whatever net adds they will have, they will have like a quarter later impact on your business?","Well, right now, we are building product in advance of their launch, and they are launching in some percentage of the US They typically, with other product launches they have done, they're going some percentage of the US and then go nationwide a quarter after that. So, I think you'll see a continued ramp in that business over the next couple of quarters just based on that build-out. Then they typically move into a really seasonal strong area as they get into the fall and kind of through that time all the way through the Superbowl. So I think that that business is going to continue to be a good ramp business for us throughout 2010 and even into early 2011. The thing that could drive growth even further than that is a bigger conversion away from standard def towards high def. Because we're high-def platforms, so as we see more and more consumers move their pay-TV service from standard def to high-def with DIRECTV as well as with everybody else in the industry, I think that's going to favor Entropic MoCA solutions.","1assistant

"Jeff, looking at the 2% to 4% internal revenue growth guidance, what are kind of the one or two biggest swing factors, particularly get to the high end of that range?","Yes, I would say it's the biggest opportunity that exists today. And earlier in 2010, early in the year in '10 -- sorry, I was getting my year straight -- we had talked about the fact that there were some larger transactions that we were in pursuit of. Some of them we could announce publicly, and some of them we could not announce publicly. And one of those happen to be WestPac, and we announced that it was a large transaction. Well, during the year, we ended up winning the transactions we thought we would be able to win. We didn't announce them because they were not announceable, but these are transactions that will be implemented over time. And the constraints that we have are really around having to contend with resource constraints within these very large financial institutions. We have to effectively get into their development queues. And some of the projects that we are working on, to the extent they can be moved in earlier, would have upside into our numbers for 2011. So that's the upside. I think on the downside, to the extent that the economy itself begins to deteriorate down to levels below what we saw last year in 2010, I think that would create some downside in our numbers. Beyond that, I would say that on balance, we would say there's probably more opportunity in our numbers if the economy stays as strong as people are talking about it staying right now. But we just don't see any reason, Chris, to get ahead of ourselves. We feel like we've got a reputation of doing what you say you're going to do, and that's what we're focused on right now.

"Just a quick follow-up on that so if the -- do you think we're going to see the other let's call the new generation of vendors, do you think they are seeing the same thing or do you think that this is somewhat Nimble specific because of your pull back on spending?","I think the place where the competitive intensity was particularly high was in the larger deals segment thatâ€™s become a larger part of our mix. So large deals are becoming a greater part of our mix every quarter and that's where we saw very aggressive competitive intensity from the large incumbents. To go one step further the frequency with which we compete against, let's say, younger companies, has been increasing by about one, two percentage points every quarter. And actually our win rates against those remain very consistent. So depending on the individual start up, I suspect they are seeing different competitive responses depending on whether they are competing on the high end or not.","1assistant

"Okay. I have to ask, to be able to get that capacity to smooth out that, what was the consideration that you had to do to get that firm transportation smooth, out that â€“ the pipeline capacity?","It's the same we're paying for all of our transportation, actually in some cases, a little bit less. What this is, we buy firm. Typically on a pipeline, you're buying long-term firm. In this case, there were operators who can't supply their firm. And for short periods of time, some of these contracts we have are 6-month type contracts. And all we're doing is buying from operators who couldn't use it. So we're buying at their rate or lower than their rate because they were going to have to pay it one way or the other.","1assistant

"All right. Maybe just one more here. In the Workforce Solutions division, obviously, the labor market is very tight. How does the Company make sure it can supply the necessary workforce or really the required engineers there?","Yes, it's a great question.

And we -- they are as much our customers as our end-user utility customers are. So we work really hard to build up great relationships with these professionals over the long term. There -- we reach out to them when projects become available, and they have the option to work when they want to and need to. So, it's really a win-win, but it's that proprietary database and contacts with highly skilled workers that really differentiates us in the marketplace.","2assistant

Great. And thatâ€™s great. And then one point of clarification here you talked about the board making a decision on the share repurchase authorization. Is it safe to say that none of the sort of noise going around that you talked about at the beginning of the call impacts your ability to repurchase stock or to authorize another repurchase program?,We donâ€™t believe so.

"Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up, looking at your gas price outlook, Steve, obviously sub-$5 with constraints on even the potential for more activity as prices go up and the power generation switchback. I mean, how do you look at the Fayetteville in sort of that light if -- I don't know what your sort of near-term look is the next, say, 3 years? Where do you see activity there at the 400, 450? Do you kind of maintain your activity that you're doing right now on the Fayetteville, or would you increase that at a certain price point?","I think from just a strategic standpoint, we really started in 2011, trying to keep the Fayetteville Shale within its cash flow with a thought that in the not too distant future it could generate excess cash flow to apply to some other things. And we do have a large backlog of wells to kind of what price we have out there. So I think as you look into the future, we will increase or decrease well count based on basically how much cash flow comes out of the Fayetteville Shale. This year, we're drilling about 400 wells. We're not quite balanced. As we look into the next year, I can tell you we'll start the year running 7 rigs. And if you ran 7 rigs all year that would be in the 350-type number well range, again, depending on how fast you're drilling those kinds of things. So we will adjust it. As price gets higher and there's more cash flow, we'll drill more wells on the other side, but I don't know how much lower we'll go from where we're at right now. That's something we're talking about in our 2013 capital plans.","2assistant

"Itâ€™s no secret that the netbook is obviously doing pretty well. Do you have any thoughts there on that category now that youâ€™ve been able to watch it for a few quarters and what you are thinking and it has obviously held up the market a bit in the recent data and you donâ€™t have it, and you still outperformed the market? Just any thoughts on where you are and where you arenâ€™t that you might want to share?","For us, itâ€™s about doing great products. And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens, and just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on quite frankly. And so, itâ€™s not a space as it exists today that we are interested in, nor do we believe that customers in the long term would be interested in. Itâ€™s a segment we would choose not to play in. That said, we do look at the space and are interested to see our customersâ€™ respond to it. People that want a small computer so to speak that does browsing and e-mail, might want to buy an iPod Touch or they might want to buy an iPhone. And so, we have other products to accomplish some of what people are buying netbooks for and so, in that particular way we play in an indirect basis. And then of course, if we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution, then we will do that and we have some interesting ideas in the space. The product pipeline is fantastic for the Mac. We are â€“ as we look back over the last four plus years, 17 of the 18 quarters of the last four-and-a-half years, weâ€™ve exceeded the market rate of growth. And to exceed in this horrendous economy, I think is quite an accomplishment, especially when you look at the â€“ that these very low-priced netbooks that are â€“ I think itâ€™s a stretch to call it a personal computer, are really propping up the unit numbers from the industry as a whole. So, we feel great about our performance. Itâ€™s a very solid performance, especially in this environment and the pipeline looks fantastic.","2assistant

The answer positively demonstrates the chosen feature, ""ASSERTIVE"", by providing specific reasons why Apple doesn't consider entering the netbook market, and also confidently stating their performance and future prospects.assistant

"Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Tim. So, there has been some mixed views on how much the earning sensitivity may be for drug distributors related to brand inflation. So, I guess just with your change in your view from what was 10% to 12% previously to 7% and 9%, is there maybe just any way to give a little more color on how much of a role that plays within your shift in the EPS growth from â€“ Looks like about 4% to 6%, to 0% to 4% for fiscal 2017? Without getting too granular, just wondering is that a big part or a small part? Just any more color would be helpful. Thanks."," I'll let Tim comment, but I just would say, most of the growth has come from the specialty drugs, most of the unit growth, but they tend to be very expensive products, of course, not that many units. And then, there has been a relatively high rate, at least in 2015 of brand price appreciation, which was in the mid-teens. But, we saw it ramp down very significantly and current trends would indicate even a further step down. We do think that an overall industry growth rate is very helpful to growing our top line and our bottom line. But we're confident we can grow in this 6% to 9% range that we expect. We said 7% to 9%, but I'm just saying within 1% or 2%. If it comes a lot below that, we think that that will create some challenges that we will address, but we don't think that that's possible in the next 12 months. Tim, would you agree to that, anything to add?","2assistant

"Okay. And then maybe just one or two follow ups on Core. I think that color on your previous terminations is pretty helpful around that 85% number. I guess my question, is this that a fairly near term expectation or did that take six to eight quarters to get that 85% retention rate? And when you do get is it sort of an even split between direct and alternate - and alternate distributor?","Yes, it is clearly is not a - to six to eight quarter period of time. It is going to be a fairly short period of time. There will be some noise in the very short term the happening as we - during this last couple of weeks and these next few weeks. But we should have a pretty good idea in one maybe two quarters at the most Constantine, of knowing where we are going to end up there. So it is not going to be a lengthy period of time at all nor was it is in the past.

As far as the channel, that's a little difficult to predict. Our objective is to retain the volume and we - as you know we have multiple channels direct as well as several distributors and each TheraSeed user is a unique case in terms of how that customer may be accessing the product for example; is it through a purchasing organization and if it is through a GPO purchasing organization perhaps there are only one or two of our channels that we can supply through.

And that may or may not be direct and so there is a lot of iterations there and it is difficult to predict. At the end of the day we are focused on retaining the volume almost regardless of the Channel.","2assistant

"Got it. So kind of a combination of mix shift to large deals and then lengthening sales cycles as pricing intensifies at least in North America with these larger enterprises. As a follow-up and thinking about next year, your guidance implies product growth of 20%, 25% here for Q4. Is that the right way to think about kind of the growth rate into next year 20%, 25%? The reason why I ask that your largest competitor EMC is potentially going private next year. Theyâ€™re going to be in a position to get even more aggressive on price next year, so it just seems like the structural change around pricing could be a permanent thing at least as we think about next year. And so how are you thinking about the appropriate product growth trends that given this pricing environment we should think about for next year?","Yes. So, I'll say one thing Brent. First, we don't give guidance thatâ€™s that long-term in nature. But I want to point out there are two factors that impacted us. The first factor is that in the large enterprise segment and in the large deal segment competitive pressure has been a factor that slowed us down. Perhaps the greater impact is that in going after those larger deals and in going after those larger enterprises, we shifted investments from our commercial segment where that is the second action that we are taking to avoid that shift in investments by reinvesting in our commercial segment is what we're doing. So, as you think about our corrective actions besides sort of strengthening our competitive position in the large enterprise segment by broadening our platform, investing in commercial over the next - first two quarters of next year is really what we are doing, which I think will translate into growth again. Beyond that, I don't want to get more detailed on specific growth numbers, Brent.","2assistant

"I don't know if I just missed it, but can you give some color how you're thinking about 2013? I know there's not -- they're not fairly specific here but just from a CapEx perspective relative to cash flow relative to this year's budget and how you're thinking about balancing between the Fayetteville and the Marcellus and New Ventures.","We really haven't given much guidance on 2013. We're still working on that. And typically towards the end of the year, we normally put out a press release that talks about our 2013. So I'd expect something later this year or early next year on actual 2013. Obviously, we talked about in the past that we're increasing rig count in the Marcellus, and we'll exit the year with 4 rigs doing basically the horizontal work there. That will increase the capital budget on the Marcellus side, so I could see a weighting that's more Marcellus-oriented next year versus the dominant last few years where the Fayetteville has been 75% to 80% of the capital. You'll see that more balanced, may not be balanced, but more balanced. And then Midstream, in general, a lot of the work's been done on the Fayetteville Shale. And in the Marcellus, we've got another year in the same category we had now where it's $80 million, $90 million. So I'd say Midstream is flat or a little bit down is really towards the future. And then as I said before on the New Ventures, expect 10% to 12% of our capital budget to go to New Ventures.","2assistant

Thanks.","Yeah, we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year, we didn't execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future.","1assistant

"Okay. And then, just a quick question on the cash obligations for the year. Any changes on the interest expense or taxes that you kind of outlined in the last call?","Tax rate -- you see our effective tax rate for the first half of the year is 35.6, that's what we are looking at for the full year. I mean, interest will be down a little bit, trending down just strictly [ph], because we reduced our senior secured facility down one percentage point. But we got a little less than $350 million at a one percentage point decrease in interest rate. We are reaping those benefits, as we speak.","2assistant

"Okay and then at a higher level, first on you guys made a decision to accelerate some investments, I think you highlighted here earlier in the call Germany, North America, Argentina, etcetera where is the decision point coming, what will be the factors that would cause you guys to perhaps accelerate some additional investments may be keeping up margins little lower in the back half of the year like you did in the first half of the year?","I think, Parry it is Greg here. As a team we've been making some investments in the acquisition front that are going to I think favorably work for us, clearly bringing better margins into the portfolio, it has been something that we've can conscientiously investing in over the last year or two to counter balance if you may the ongoing pressures in what I call the volume of commodity side of the portfolio. But that also brings with it to some extent some incremental cost because those are higher margins and usually slightly higher cost to build those revenues into the company. So I think those will be factors that will help us in the back half of the year and I think overall just improvements in our performance that we have got some of the first half of your challenges out of our way. We really do feel that most of the challenges that we were managing through Q3 or Q4 of last year going into the first half of this year are out of our way. So while the market is always interesting we have got most of the internal challenges out of our way right now which is good for us.","2assistant

So, the timing of them kind of moving to that, we'd like if they did, would be in kind of the â€“ probably the 2012 timeframe. That's definitely an opportunity that we would like to pursue with MoCA 2 and we are focused on having a dialog with AT&T around that.

And I know you've got plans for plant kind of Greenfield type stuff and expansions on your own. But should we expect you guys to start kind of ramp it up on the on the M&A front?

We can invest through just our normal CapEx. If we come kind pf across opportunities, that are a good value at good multiples. We can be opportunistic, we can pay down debt.

"Well, I was just wondering if you have any or what the contingency plans are, supposing the data does not live up to expectations, supposing you have to increase your trial size, I mean, how does that plan or play out in terms of licensing the product?","I understand. Well, first of all, we will look at the data and understand a lot about it, when Mark has the chance to get the full analysis from the outside vendor. So, there are many different ways that data could come out, certainly if for some unexpected reason, it was clearly negative and there was evidence of a futility here and we would stop the trial as you know GenVec has substantial efforts in other areas. Well funded programs in the areas of vaccine development primarily but also we have other important programs. So, I think we are in a fortunate position compared to many companies in which the technology is broadly ample. So, we are not just focused on TNFerade as it relates to the future but the pipeline, which is driven by the vaccine programs, Doug, actually highlighted couple of important points. One, is the RSV and the HSV-2 program, which we will notice as the company is beginning to build through outside funding, proprietary programs which could also drive the value of the company.","2assistant

And then I don't know if I missed this but the whole blood revenues that you are actually expecting for fiscal â€˜15 and how much share repurchase is actually incorporated into your guidance.","But as part of that, Larry, what would say is weâ€™re committed to spending about $160 million in our VCC initiatives, so you can do the math in terms of what will be left after what we spent in fiscal â€˜14 and â€™15.

"Final question just, Ken, you make a really important statement in the press release where you say and you said it in your prepared script, but you acknowledge the U.S. market conditions are more challenging than expected. You said the quarter came out EPS-wise where you expected and you maintain guidance. So there's just -- itâ€™s like you to connect the dots for me, if everything is more difficult, but yet EPS comes out as expected. In a way I feel like I am getting a little bit of both here, I am getting that, your plans coming out as advertised, but then you're making the statement that no, no, no watch out, the environment is tougher. I feel like we should be worried about the guidance, but I'd like you to comment on what this comment means and how confident you are in the full year numbers?","Well, I mean, it means that we're staying with our guidance because that's the way the business looks to us right now as we look forward, but we do acknowledge that the environment is more challenging, so there is some risk around that profile. But we do think because of the factors that we talked about earlier in the call, which is that we -- the trade which was a primary issue this quarter, the trade will normalize, some of the bigger volume drags will strengthen, coupled again with the positive momentum that we have in a number of areas of the business. Those factors all combined and then again on the -- with well controlled on the cost side, we are guiding to our full year guidance for the year and that we will recover there as we go through the next three quarters. I think the wildcard is the category and we don't know whether theyâ€™re going to be a headwind, a tailwind, or a neutral. I think thatâ€™s the unknown right now. Weâ€™re encouraged somewhat by what weâ€™re seeing over the last several weeks. They seem to be strengthening, but whether thatâ€™s going to be a headwind or a tailwind remains to be seen. But in any event, our job is to execute around innovation and core brand renovation and make sure weâ€™ve got strong consumer programs drive the business that way and that's our plan, we like the plans that we have and thatâ€™s why we feel confident right now about maintaining guidance.","2assistant

"Good morning. I wonder if you could give us a flavor for the trends geographically, what your potential exposure is to Europe, which is weakening in many countries and how much benefit you might be getting from strength in Asia and Latin America?","Alex, that is always very company specific and market specific. But I think we have a slide in our deck that shows our growth rate year-to-date. And the majority of our growth has come in Asia; that's been electronically driven. Plus, the other companies that we have that have strong Asian presence such as Knowles and others. Europe for us was actually up from a growth rate standpoint this year over last. Again, we have some businesses performing well there. Imaje, our product ID company certainly is located in Europe. SWEP [ph] has had a very good run in its heat exchanger business in Europe and we continue to see radar continues [ph] to build. They opened a new plant in China during the quarter. So they will... that will be increasing their international presence. So across the board, pretty good global engagement here. I know a lot of people are talking about Europe pulling back. Our rate of growth in Europe has kind of held in there fairly well. In fact, DE-STA-CO, which serves the automotive market in general is down certainly in U.S. The project with Audio and VW or Volkswagen in Europe have continued to keep that business quite active.","2assistant

"Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. Can you give us any update on time lines for an EFS look and the CheckMate -816 trial? And how do you think the overall market there and the potential opportunity there is impacted by the Roche and Power ONO positive announcement. And then, secondly, on the TYK2 given the strong results you saw in moderate-to-severe patients and then, also the attempted advanced study in mild to moderate.
Any plans to maybe run an additional head-to-head study versus Otezla in a mild-to-moderate patient population to expand the opportunity?
","Great. Thank you. And in terms of the TYK2 versus Otezla product, I think, first of all, we are excited about the data that we have. We have, obviously, the mechanism of action that is quite unique over here.
We've seen the data in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We have additional studies that are ongoing in the IBD space, in the lupus space. The discussion around moderate to severe -- mild to moderate psoriasis continues. And we'll certainly share with you ultimately what the plans would be.
But truly excited today where we are, and certainly, the evolution of the data at the end of the year in additional indications. We are not ready to share yet our plans for mild-to-moderate psoriasis.

"The interest in the new consoles is very encouraging and the -- I guess, the discounts that we also have attached to it versus the last cycle launch may not have been warranted. I'm curious, as you look out 6 to 9 months from now, when you get through this initial gamer-centric demand, how do you feel about the visibility of the console demand at that point in time past the initial rush? Are you feeling better about that at this point? Or it's just hard to say?","Yes, I think to that point, we've actually modeled the PS4 and Xbox One. Yes, in our model, they were modeled less and less but pretty close. I think one of the reasons why the total number was down had more to do with the performance of the Wii. But everything we're seeing to this point is very, very positive. I think we made the point earlier what PowerUp Rewards does is allow us to go inside and see what consumers are doing. It would be -- obviously, it would be a mistake to take the number of PowerUp members and literally multiply it by the percentage. But when -- anytime you're seeing a base of 25 million, 26 million people and you're seeing a very, very high percentage, 2/3 have been indicating very positive purchase interest, what it says to us is that the demand is very strong, and it's going to take a long time for the supply to catch up with that demand. So I think everything we're seeing suggests very, very strong demand not only now but for a very long period of time. Keep in mind that 26 million people in the program, a lot of those people are not just core gamers, right? We have a very, very broad segment of the population in there. And then I think another point that Tony mentioned earlier is value. One of the things that we think is going to be a big deal is our ability to make the systems through our trade programs affordable for millions of people who couldn't otherwise afford them. So between the demand, the ability to provide value and hopefully, a strong lineup of new titles coming out next year, we think there's a number of things that can continue to make the console demand strong for the foreseeable future.","2assistant

"And final question, Steve, what are your thoughts, obviously, very tight infrastructure in the Marcellus about basis differentials in that marketplace. So what are you seeing today?","Well, because we have firm capacity, today we're seeing NYMEX pretty much flat. Some months, it's a couple cents above; some months a little bit low. We have not seen anything we've had to do much as a blowout that you might have seen or heard earlier in the year in some of the other areas. As we look out in the future, we think that the Marcellus will pull away on the basis a little bit. So our long-term planning is actually it widens and it's going to be a NYMEX minus some kind of a number but near term, NYMEX flat.","2assistant

"Okay, okay. And your Snowmobile, do you have orders right now from your dealers? Donâ€™t you usually have your orders by April or so?","We do. We had our Snowmobile dealers show at the end of February, beginning of March, which is when we take orders from probably 80-some percent of our dealers and then obviously, we will get orders over the next couple of months. And so weâ€™re just in the process now of going ahead and bringing those together and to figure out what the wholesale will be for the year. ","2assistant

"That's great. Yeah. If you can do all three, I think that would be fantastic. And then just a quick follow-up. On Japan, just can you walk us through the decision not to apply for price increase on Marlboro?","Well, I mean I think it's pretty obvious if you look at to what the price increase our key competitor has announced earlier this quarter. So we in some part are also reacting of â€“ to the price moves announced or registered by others. So I think it's pretty obvious why we just selected that part of the portfolio.","2assistant

"Okay. And then just maybe one follow-up. You guys I'm sure get a lot of the same questions in terms of the potential decline in the amount of UNIX to Linux opportunity there is out there. I guess, when you looked at the fourth quarter numbers or you look at it over a 12-month basis, I guess is there any real -- I guess everybody is thinking there's some sort of ledge that we're coming to. Do you see any real, I guess, risk of that over the next 12 months? Or do you still see that as a pretty fertile opportunity for you all?","I -- well, I mean I think the healthcare deal we talked about is a great example. While we've done a lot of work replacing UNIX in areas like financial services and in telecommunications, if we look at mainstream verticals, we're still in the early days with a lot of very large companies who are -- kind of walk [ph] on the late majority. And that makes up a big, big, big chunk of the UNIX footprint out there. Those are also typically for us a little bit higher price points as people are looking for kind of the higher levels of service and our higher levels of subscription. So I don't think we see at all right now any slowing in that momentum. It's just a move from the early adopters to the kind of late majority in terms of the customers that are now making those migrations. The good news for us is they're big. And so things like healthcare, I think you'll see more deals in sectors like that as we go forward.","2assistant

"Okay. Then just lastly on the HyperSpace side, without any revenue comments, can you give us any metrics that we can monitor the interest level; any general sense on the number of downloads to-date or how much has been the free trial versus purchased?","Well, we havenâ€™t initiated any sort of marketing activity that will generate significant volumes. The ASUS contract is one of the first ones that could generate leads in the millions and given the current economic climate, weâ€™ve canceled our Super Bowl ad, so that will wreck our leads for it right there. So you have to spend money to get leads in significant numbers or you have to have a partner and our partner in this business is the OEMs. Like I said, given the economic climate, the amount of advertising and another kind of lead generation weâ€™ll be doing, would be minimal. So weâ€™ve got to get the OEMs in gear to generate millions of leads and that will generate interesting and significant numbers and weâ€™re signing them up left and right.

"Tim, could you also comment on your thinking about expanding iPhone adoption. Recently when â€“ you have said that one area where you are spending a lot of time is thinking about how to increase the adoption of the iPhone and you have been thinking a lot about elasticity. One comment that it struck me was that you were surprised by from your research at the elasticity that you thought was associated with the price of the device. Can you update me on your thinking or what you have learned about iPhone elasticity, now a quarter or later?","Well, yes, we had a very good quarter in the March quarter. With actually a very small sequential declines for holiday quarter which was far above what our expectations were, so weâ€™re very pleased with how we did. We also announced 3.0 or previewed it developers so that they could begin to change their apps, introduce more apps for the phone, which we believe increases the ecosystem and increases the number of people that want and will buy phone itâ€™s even more. And so weâ€™re very focused on the products side. Weâ€™re very focused on the App Store. There we are also focused on geographic rollouts. We spent time this quarter on the Middle East and Asia and rolled up Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand to name a few and weâ€™re obviously focused on more in the future. And so between those the product plans that weâ€™ve got in the App Store and the software that you have seen and then things I canâ€™t talk about, we have a plan that we believe continues to make us the leader in the space, continues to keep us years ahead of others and one of the things that we will make sure is that we donâ€™t leave a price umbrella for people.","2assistant

"Got it, okay. And then on that mix, I mean, when historically weâ€™ve talked about contractor margins and I know that itâ€™s come from the investor base and us asking hey, can you get back to previous peak margins in contractor. But seeing that you are seeing a mix shift kind of headwind on the margin side there, one -- is the focus on the home center lower margin stuff, is that a strategic focus near term? If yes, why? And I guess second, how should we be thinking about the margin potential for the segment longer term?
","So in terms of the folks at the organization up there, they are launching new products across a variety of categories. We are launching a lot of new products into the pro paint as well as into the home center market. The home center has been a growth driver for us over the course of last three years or four years as we have been able to capture the major home center customers here in the U.S. We are pretty well positioned now, so it will be more challenging to put up the big, huge home center growth numbers of the underlying business, isnâ€™t there. Because weâ€™ve got shelf space everywhere. From a strategic perspective, I like the home center business. It does a lot of good things, I think, for the organization, despite the fact that itâ€™s got lower profitability. It certainly has taught us a lot about how to manufacture and design products to hit lower price points in the market. And we can use that knowledge as we move up through our product line. It also gives us volume and allows us to have component level quantities on some parts that can be shared across product lines that are much higher volume and more cost effective than they would be had we not had that business. And really, finally, if somebody wants to try to attack our pro-business and we see the home center business and they have the ability to sell thousands of sprayers at lower price points in that market, itâ€™s likely only a matter of time before they expand their product range up. So thereâ€™s a variety of reasons to be there, but I donâ€™t want anybody to think that weâ€™ve lost our focus on the pro-business. The pro-business is our bread-and-butter. And thatâ€™s where weâ€™re launching all sorts of new products every year and actually doing very well.","2assistant

Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I have to two really. We've talked for years about a movement towards the ASC. Are you seeing that accelerate or the same or is there any color that you can put around that?,"Yes Joanne, I mean we've talked about this before. We certainly, the pandemic did create an acceleration of a trend that was already starting with regards to the shift in ASC and we would expect that to continue. We feel very strong about our offense and very good about our offense that we have with regard to the ASC and really being able to bring and leverage the full power of our product portfolio in that setting. So we're very comfortable with that shift and certainly believe that we have the products to satisfy that shift and really be able to take advantage of that trend.","2assistant

"Michele, I like to follow up on the Reese's Snack Cake. You mentioned that it's small right now, but Hershey went down this path about 15 years ago, and it didn't really translate into anything material. So I'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now. Does this maybe mark a new phase over the snack section evolution and I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean does it compete against the Twinkie, the cookies? Just where is the target market? Any big picture of thoughts would be appreciated.","Yeah, absolutely. So I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a mass launch, where we just threw it out there and try to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time. But we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time, so that we could really learn about the proposition.
We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area and we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So this, for example, is very C-store focused.
It is a single serve type of item, so we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the snack cake market. So yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands.
We know that we had participated in this category for many years through licensing and we learned through that that our brands could participate and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend and our confection item skew more to afternoon and evening.
So this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth, because that is where these snack cakes get utilized. So again, we're going to have a very focused rollout and we'll put it in locations, where we think we can garner incremental space and where we think there is a strong consumer fit and starting at C-store and looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform well, we will expand. But we will watch it closely and take a measured approach.","2assistant

"Okay. And then just a quick question on the EEMA region, where you had quite a nice volume recovery in the third quarter. I'm assuming Turkey will reverse. But I'm wondering about Ukraine as well, which had strong growth in the quarter. Does that reverse in the fourth quarter, i.e. is the third quarter impact undone? Or does it just normalize in Ukraine?","Ukraine is now normalizing. Q3 of this year, actually, in terms of comparison benefits from a very weak Q3 of last year. Q3 2010 had to de-load after the July 2010 price increase, which had a load in Q2 of 2010. So therefore, I mean, we are benefiting in Q3 now from these relatively easy comps. And we are now kind of out of that, and we should see now a situation that normalizes in the Ukrainian markets. Let's hope that we have no new disruptions, nothing on the horizon.

" Okay. And then maybe one other one. Just in â€“ you have the PPP funds and diligent in how you use them. But when we think about the use of the accordion as well as you highlighted is that â€“ should we think of that as really just offloading current borrowings on the revolver, or will the accordion also be needed to fund in addition to that ongoing cost of the business? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much â€“ in a way it's a question about free cash flow."," Yes. I think the accordion is going to be important and the money can be fungible here. But if you're booking it in the buckets, the accordion is going to be really important for our non-operating expenditures as we look forward. And we'll look to draw it down as slow as possible because it's expensive cash. But it will be important as far as funding non-operating expenditures is kind of how I think about it.","2assistant

Okay. Great. And just the uptake of the analytics and security stuff that you've seen thus far?,"Yes. I think it's really interesting. I mean it's an early model, been in the market now for a few months. And so we've done more of a limited release, just trying to learn and grow. The business is still immaterial from a dollar standpoint. It's doubling sequentially. I think it's really driving from a model standpoint what we've laid out. It's the opportunity to go back is to, frankly, anybody that is â€“ that is a long time Citrix customer, but the most value being added, of course, those that have converted to the cloud and layer on unique insights, not just as one more monitoring tool, but there's things that are really driving more autonomous actions to help drive a better security model, better performance model and all the contextual attributes that we've talked about. So you can see the pricing out there and kind of draw a picture back to what the overall TAM is. But over time, this could be a really material business, and that's how we're looking at it. It's just early on right now, so I'm just a little bit cautious in putting out early term expectations.","1assistant

"Okay. So in terms of the 2018 outlook then, what are your expectations? Do we continue to sort of see a flattish or declines in SG&A? You put out a target of 10% to 10.5% of sales, SG&A and R&D the last quarter around. Do you see downside â€“ could that be lower given the revenue trends? And then just in terms of the ERP investment, how does that sort of play into it? Do we see a higher ERP spend in the first half of this year? Just sort of give us an outlook on sort of SG&A and how that trends.","Yes. Well, we stick our guidance of those numbers that you mentioned in terms of SG&A as a percent of revenue. In terms of the ERP system, as I said before, weâ€™ll have additional costs but at the same time weâ€™re taking cost out. Weâ€™re basically going â€“ as I said before, weâ€™re going to the cloud, so we will not â€“ we will gradually get off our AS400 legacy type platforms.

"And then maybe one final one. Can you talk about the relative distribution of 1005 to the brain, what results systemically?","The -- I don't have very good information for you about the relative concentrations in tissues outside the brain versus inside the brain in humans. What I can tell you is that at the doses and schedule that we're using in the Phase II program, the concentrations of 1005 inside the brain and particularly in tumors inside the brain is in double-digit micromolar concentrations, which is way in excess of what is required for anti-tumor activity.","1assistant

"And then just on the games POS, is that 30% growth rate versus 2019 a good two-year expectation as we move through the year?

In fact, already year to date, we have the No. 1 new game in the marketplace according to NPD, which is the Foosketball, and it's been really well received.
We have a number of new games in MONOPOLY and several new original games coming as well. So very strong plans for games for the year.

"Okay. And then, with regard to the cost reduction efforts that you said would allow Veritiv to reduce some of the pricing on products, is that mostly for Print and Publishing or is that kind of across the portfolio? And do you see yourselves getting priced out of some business that you could see volumes picking up a bit more as pricing comes down?","Yeah. So, let's clarify, John. I do not believe I said that the cost reduction would lead to lower end prices to our customers. That is not the plan at all. In fact, we believe that we've got opportunities for margin improvement in the business over the course of time due to both inflationary factors that are impacting the business and our ability to better manage price just by having a consolidated set of systems. One point of truth, I guess, is one way to look at instead of two or three. So, we are not speaking to lowering prices in the marketplace at all. The cost reduction initiatives are broad-based just because of the enablement that the integration has given us. That come from process improvement, which leads to lower operating cost, lower headcount costs that should be part of the benefits of going through the integration.","2assistant

"I just had a couple of questions. One is, I was reading an article recently about -- I think it might have been Devon, but I don't recall exactly who it was, one of the larger producers, that they have gone through experimentation to a process of drilling the laterals from drilling long 3,000-, 4,000-foot laterals to drilling much shorter laterals kind of on a radial basis around the core borehole. And in some cases, have been able to get flows of upwards of 6,000 barrels a day. For how long, I don't know, but is that technology something that we're looking at?","Well, we're following it, Curt. I don't think it's applicable in the shales that we're working in. I'm not aware of it anywhere in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken. I think they're experimenting with that in some of the West Texas shales. So certainly, it's something -- we're always looking at what the industry's doing. It's not always easy to get that information. Some of the bigger companies keep it pretty confidential. But I think we're on top of what's going on in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, and that's what counts for us.","1assistant

" Right. And then, Anil, can you give us an update on your thoughts on both timing and relative impact of 5G on spend to you guys?"," I think we see a very small impact of 5G, but there is an indirect impact on our 4G solution because of the software strategy. So, as people are looking for 5G solutions, they will traditionally look for incumbents who can satisfy their needs both from a budget and a value perspective. So, moving to a software model, the dynamic I just described, allows us to be the number one player in the 5G area, but it's not going to really impact â€“ have any meaningful impact on the revenue in the coming years.","1assistant

"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks, again, Lowell, congrats to you and Hans. Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower-tax guide.
Could you talk about the reasons why that is, and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation? And do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about, I think, as we've done, historically, some of the changes in the union contract forthcoming, how should we think about that impact on the cost structure? I know you gave us about a 20% margin in the wireline side for this year. But is that -- did those negotiations give you some window and potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.
","Yes. David, we're -- we're really pleased with the relationship that we built with the union. During the last contract, we get together at the senior level very frequently. We've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both the union leadership and members as well as the company.
So when we decided -- attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of exploration that was a major change in our relationship. And I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections, I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen. We do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing, but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract.
But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers, and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike. And so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.

"Hey. Thank you for taking my question. One more on cloud. So on this perspective that you'll have flat revenues between this year and last year, I was wondering how your mix is going to -- you see your mix evolving? And a couple of things I have in mind is, what you sell at the lower end of the hierarchy in access, server access at the lease level versus things you sell higher for DCI, for universal spine.And also - or maybe another way to look at the split would be Tomahawk based products versus based products versus Jericho-based product. Do you see a significant evolution in that mix between this year and last year? Thank you.","Thank you, Pierre. I would say in a short answer is no. We've always had a very nice mix of value products with the Tomahawk and Trident family connecting to servers. Sorry, the volume product and then the value products with the Jericho family with the 7,280 and 7,500 flagship, so depending on the use cases, customers opt for both.They're both very, very popular products, and both are currently challenges the lead times as well. It's not so much that we're seeing a change in product mix. I would say the biggest change we're seeing is people are doubling down on 100-gig and 400-gig is getting pushed out next year in the cloud.","2assistant

Or is there enough of an offset on the gross margin/OpEx, too?"," No, I think that decrement is probably â€“ I think the decrement flows through and, in our prepared remarks, we said we anticipated that the earnings per share for the first quarter would be anywhere between $0.05 to $0.08.","2assistant

"I guess, Charlie, maybe just following up on Ross' question just on some of the seasonality on bookings. I think Jim mentioned that a lot of the off balance sheet backlog was booked in the fourth quarter. And given the stock's down because the sort of the absolute billings print, if I take into account, that a lot of those bookings were done in fourth quarter, did bookings actually accelerate from 3Q to 4Q? Because if most of that business was done in the fourth quarter, that would seem to be a reasonable assumption.","Yes, I mean bookings historically has always accelerated in our fourth quarter. As I said in my commentary, it's a very -- the pattern of the business has been very consistent year-over-year. The first quarter is the lowest; second quarter is a little bit better; third quarter's quite a bit better than the second quarter; and the fourth quarter usually booms. So we get back right back into the same pattern because of the recurring revenue nature of a subscription.","2assistant

"And then I just want to ask about the operational effectiveness of $25 million. I guess that's kind of below last year's objective of $40 million, and I know the goal is, over five years, $250 million. So can you just help us understand, is that number get greater as we go forward?
","Yes, it will continue to build, Bryan. And that really is the same number that we presented on Investor Day, so that $25 million, because the next area of savings in the $250 million comprises of data center transformation and a number of other areas. But that $25 million ramps up significantly to year two to over $50 million. We're not giving guidance on that right now. But clearly, it's going to ramp up, and we have our plans. We're executing alone those plans and continue to refine those to accelerate as much of that as we can into 2011, keeping in mind the quality of our delivery and pacing that correctly over the next few years. So we are continue to refine those plans. Mark is going to be helping a lot in that regard to execute that over the next five years, and we remain very confident in our ability to be able to obtain that $250 million.","2assistant

"Â And then just one question about the retail business, I know you had indicated that year-over-year excluding that $2.6 million charge, it would have improved and I could have a flaw in my model but I was under the impression that last year also had a one-time benefit that hit the -- took about it was like a $1.1 million of costs so that if you exclude both from both years it actually would be down, is that inventory markdown?","The map as you describe it, Karen, is absolutely right but from an operating perspective the flavor behind that I don't think is so correct because when you look at what we did a year ago, we took a $1.1 million cash charge because we were closing stores because something was wrong. The business wasn't performing. We were hurting. We had to get out of some operations.

To me, that's a whole different proposition from when you take a $2.6 million charge simply because you chose to change an estimate in your promotional markdowns. There was no pressure to do that. Nothing was wrong. Nothing's broken. So I think that the issue that we have is that we've put it on the same line and that I think causes people to want to compare those two. In reality, I don't really see them as comparable items because I was under no pressure to make the change in estimate that impacted the $2.6 million, but I can assure you that a year ago I was clearly under pressure to do something to stop the bleeding in some of these stores that were underperforming. I just see them as entirely two different things and not apples and apples.

But the math as you describe it is 100% right. There's nothing wrong with the map. My point is, is that if I had closed stores last year and I close stores this year, those are comparable apples and apples. I haven't closed any stores. Nothing is wrong with my business. I just simply chose to change an estimate in promotional markdowns in order to more effectively manage my business and I think that's hard to compare that to a year ago when we were closing stores because we had real problems out there.","2assistant

But some of that is just the seasonality of the business and particularly in Europe. We see much less travel during the summer, and Egencia did see a fairly high increases in average ticket prices.

"Got it. Two more quick things; one, you made mention of zero base budgeting, and is that something that you have done before or is that a -- obviously a change in strategy, because that's a pretty -- can be a pretty serious shift, in the way a company thinks about its cost structure. Typically really good systems also have been, historically in my experience, required to be able to do ZBB in a way where it can be successful. So I am trying to get a sense there of how big a shift that is for you?","We have done it in the past occasionally, when we ran into difficulties. The decision to do with this -- at this point in time, probably reflects the fact that, we had a very good run for a good number of years and had some very excellent results and perhaps haven't challenged ourselves on the cost side as hard as we should have, and its time to put ourselves up against the wall and ask some hard questions again.","2assistant

"Good morning and thanks for taking two questions. The first one is on the U.S. volumes that you actually intend to keep, so not what you are trying to de-market, but the volumes that you actually like. Could you talk about what you are seeing there in terms of demands? You seem to talk about softness, so I am just wondering where you're seeing the softness. And the second question is on guidance sequence. I guess you are going to face tougher comps in Canada and in Europe in the second half. And that's exactly when you are trying -- when you are intending to accelerate. Can you talk about whether this will -- this should come from I guess acceleration in Canada and in Europe? Or, is it just the U.S. business seeing traction from the turnaround and accelerating extremely fast between the first half and the second half? Thank you.","So I think the reason that we're more bullish on the second half clearly it has to do with the skill set, the new people that we're hiring. And we still have a lot of positions in the U.S. for sellers. And we are picky about who we hire. Very particularly about who we hire. So it takes little more time to attract, train, develop, and then get them in the game and have them go through the sales cycle and grab the business. So that work is ongoing. But we see time on our side to make it better, faster, stronger. And I think that's the reason for the delta and the uptick we expect later in the year. If you just kind of look at our progression all I mean the fourth quarter, we saw some turning. The first quarter, we are seeing turning in the U.S. while we've maintained the growth outside the U.S. And it's absolutely true the comps for the second half were stronger but our organization is stronger. And we had more time to implement and execute on the goals that we've established. I will just add more comment on this because I think it's very important to understand the complexity around this kind of change. We're talking about culture change here. And you can't wave wand or give everybody a shot and expect it to take hold. It takes reinforcement, it takes constant repetition, it takes leadership. It takes having the right people onboard who want to go a new way and want to succeed. And that takes time. And we are moving fast. Frankly, I think quite fast given the situation we've been in. But, we want to build the foundation properly and we want this to be sustainable. And so, you can expect that this should be a natural build. Our company - I will look at it this way, our company is getting better; getting better every day. You can't see that. We are getting every month. You can't see that. But you can see that each quarter, we are getting better. And the U.S. is so -- it's such a nucleus for our turnaround. It's such an important heavy weighted element of our overall business, that's the part that we have to get right. I mean we're pretty darn -- we are never fully satisfied. That's just not the nature of the management team here. But we are pleased with what's going on in Europe. We are pleased with what's going on in Canada. It's right here in the U.S. that we got to make the change. Those changes, you are seeing the signs. You look at the third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter, and that progression continues. That is going to raise the vote for us.","2assistant

"Thank you very much. Jayshree, I was hoping you could give us some insight into the way enterprise executives are thinking about conditions, what they're thinking about in terms of? How they're approaching spending? You made a comment that I think is probably accurate, which is you're more concerned about COVID in the back half.And I assume thatâ€™s not supply chain related. It's more demand related. I would assume that you've done a lot of calls with top executives at firms. What are they saying to you about the business in process, the programs that are already in place are getting completed.But maybe the pipeline is falling off as you exit the second quarter and that there expectations for spending in the back half may be hard to put it any other way, sharply constrained?","Right. So Alex, that's a good question. I think our enterprise decision-makers and key executives are struggling within once in 100-year phenomena, just the way we are, right? They all do have 2020 plans and deadlines. And they would very much like to work with Arista and overcome the supply constraints to meet them. And I believe they will.I believe they'll also take -- many of them will also take not just a 2020 horizon, but a multiyear horizon. And start thinking about how to plan for projects in this virtual world. So we do see some systematic prudent planning. And while we don't have visibility to that demand, we don't think demand will be challenged significantly if they plan prudently.Where we think demand will be challenged, like I said before, is new projects. People are familiar with Arista, people who have to do a lot more testing with Arista, people who love Arista, but haven't had a chance yet to get their hands on it.So that part of enterprise customers â€“ may be more comfortable with doing nothing or being as is. But certainly, the 6,000-plus customers we engage with really, really want to work with us, and we'll continue to plan their projects this year or next year","2assistant

"Just a follow-up on some previous questions. As we think about seasonality for modeling next year and give -- so can you comment on whether there's supply issues might really hit more sort of the first quarter and the overall seasonality next year, should we think about a normal year or perhaps a little more back-end loaded?","Glenn, again, we're -- my answer on the supply really relates to Q4, which is what we're most keen on locking in. We're still kind of working with our suppliers relative to whether there's any impact on Q1 and we can't really give you an answer, positive or negative, right now to that effect. We're not seeing any alarm bells. We just haven't finished all our analysis with our suppliers on Q1 yet for supply. And then, again, as Joe said, 2012, we want to give you a little bit of color today because there's been a lot of questions just in terms of which direction we think IT spending is going to go. We've given you a view of a direction. And then, really, apart from that, we really want to keep our comments on everything else to do with 2012 until we get together again in January when we'll give you a lot more color on what we're seeing out there.","1assistant

"A question and a follow-up question on the same topic. The main question is, can you give us a little bit more details on â€“ it looks like the gross margins came in quite a bit more healthier or stronger than projected. Can you give us some details on that? And then I guess on the forward guidance, should we expect gross margins to be relatively stable as we progress through the year or is there some volatility or changes seasonally through your gross margins as we look at potentially coming into a better environment, Jure, that youâ€™d mentioned?","But, Jim, if I can add to that. For us right now is just loading these plants with better product mix and expanding these businesses that allows us to make a little bit better margin. And I think as we grow, those businesses should help us to improve the margins. So thatâ€™s the focus.","1assistant

"In the magazine/catalog, book catalog, book carrier, could you isolate? Were they all up? Were 2 out of 3 up, 1 out of 3 up?","And then just staying on books for a second, we had 14 of the top 20 bestsellers in 2012 in our platform. As Dan mentioned, you know and everyone else knows the states are still struggling from a financial standpoint. A couple of states are turning their deficit around to have a small surplus. We think that they will put some money back into curriculum as it relates -- it's not going to be electronic devices at this stage, as far as I believe. Over the next couple of years, at some point, it will, but I don't think -- I think K-12 will still be physical. And then what we've done on the supply chain for books was warehousing. We're having more and more conversations with publishers as far as how we can make their distribution network better, their -- take out costs for them. So I think the platform that we have, again, bodes well for physical distribution and content. I'd like to thank everybody for joining today's call.

"Yes, hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, building somewhat on earlier questions, I'd love a little bit more color around your general mind-set heading into '21, as you work through your planning process. Clearly there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year international, movie theaters, vending specialty, etc. and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead.
But at the same time, you've been gaining a lot of share, you've had great success in at-home categories like baking and with initiatives like S'mores, all of which is fantastic momentum, but again could set up for difficult year-over-year comparisons.
So as you size it altogether, I guess is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level, to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just net each other out in your mind or are you approaching '21 planning, thinking we've got either a net easier or net harder set up versus what one might consider typical? Thanks.","Yeah. So we're pleased with the momentum that we are seeing and I would say your call-outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs in the business I think are very accurate. We believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment.
And we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So this year, obviously it was consumer shifted to take home and so we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed up baking and we leaned into create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity, giving consumers new ways to participate in Halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions and they have just evolved.
As I mentioned, we were able to dial-in and accelerate e-commerce. And I think as we look to next year, we are prepared if the consumer pivots, yet again, to be able to pivot with them. I think we've built and we've demonstrated an ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an executional perspective, whether it's at retail or in our manufacturing facility.
So we're very focused on that. We've captured as well some cultural positive effects, I think capabilities we've built in terms of operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly and we think that is an enabler for us going forward. So we feel -- we feel good about that, as we look to the future.","2assistant

Brett Rice - Janney Montgomery Scott,"Yes. I mean look we have to be careful. We don't, we can't, speculate speak on behalf of other parties right. There are public disclosures, press releases that deal with that particular dispute. And the dispute revolves around in alliance that the parties have agreed to about a year ago. And - and I don't know that I can say a lot more than that but I can tell you that there are some press releases out there that will tell you about the same thing.

You have proper - I think I do agree with the way you worded or the way you explained what you understand our position to be. We're taking a bit of a risk; it is the calculated risk because our - any actions that we may initiate on our side may have an effect that winds up reducing chances of succeeding in our two objectives which is getting paid in full, right and retaining the volume. Remember besides trying to give Core an opportunity to settle that dispute, there is something else going on, which is Core is trying to finish up their financing.

And so there are a lot of moving parts and it is a very fluid situation. I can tell you that I personally speak with the executive management at Core 1 to 2 times a week sometimes more frequently. And I can also say that up to this point the management at Core in my opinion is been very transparent with us and has been very co-operative in trying to - in understanding our issues as we start our work through this with them.

"Hi, everybody, thanks for the question. I realized that China's a small part of your business, but just curious what you're seeing on the ground there with the China tenders and the volume based procurements there. I think that was supposed to happen at some point here in the next few months and if there was an update on that front?","Hey, Travis, thanks for the question. In terms of the VDP in China, it is something that's ongoing. We don't have any major updates at this point is we're waiting on feedback on the process. I think one thing to note, that you mentioned is certainly China is a smaller part of our business. And then as we focus on the products that are actually, potentially under the tenders, there's an even smaller component of our business. So just something to keep in mind as we think about the overall impact that could be coming from VDP on our business.

So we expect to hear back something later in the third quarter. And at that point in time, we'll take a look at it. The one thing that we know is just based on the timing we don't expect it to have any significant impacts on our 2021 numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and it will be something that we will contemplate as we go into 2022.","2assistant

"First, Dennis on the military segment you said the system remains challenged there, can you give us an idea on how the broader military commissary system is trending on sales right now?","Actually, as we turned the calendar quarter, [indiscernible] performance seems to have improved. Now, we donâ€™t have numbers yet for January, but our numbers are showing growth through the first eight weeks of the year which is different than what we experienced all of last year. I suspect DeCA is probably showing some growth as well. Itâ€™s modest growth but it is growth. Weâ€™ve done a lot of hard work in this segment. Weâ€™ve got a great leadership team in place. Weâ€™ve won some new business over the past six months, and we expect that will show up in the revenue stream. As such, Dave indicated weâ€™re forecasting positive sales in that segment this year.","2assistant

Also on the margin question and to make sure I understand it. How much was the actual product damages versus just the additional cost related to shipping product out to Korea and Japan. Were there pallets that needed to get resent and more one-time damages that wereâ€¦," There were a number of issues that we faced. Products â€“ sometimes the specs are very tight for Japan and they really are much tighter than the U.S. project were perfectly capable in the U.S. We were being inspected and we are being rejected for minor things, the blemishes and scratches and thereâ€™s a whole host of things and dense â€“ they have some pressure issues on cap rates and defective cap issues. So were a whole lot of issues there and again just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And itâ€™s something that is just difficult to ship full Cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to regain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But it got to a point where literally every case had to be disassembled, examined Can-by-Can and then repacked and thatâ€™s where the costs became very high, and as a result our margins were very little but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching and we needed to continue and the result is weâ€™ve been able to establish our brand very strong, very solidly in the Japanese market but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all these different regions, but as we go forward we hope that we will avoid the damages, we hope we will avoid having to continue these very costly labor and meddling inspections to satisfy our Japanese customers and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards which are just very exerting because compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S.","1assistant

" Okay. Got it. Thanks. Also wanted to ask more broadly about your Lift Truck outlook for 2018 as well. It looks like you are going to be having some kind of growth this year. Even if the market is flat, thanks to some of your hopefully good initiatives to kind of gain share. That sounds very positive. I am just kind of wondering, if your long term goal is still to get to that 115,000 units pre-Maximal capacity. You rather and get it to a 10% plus growth this year in units. Is that still feasible, based on what you know or could you maybe -- into the teens, if possible, or could you might fall short of that 10% growth that you might need to kind of keep that ramp going towards the full 115,000 to 2018?"," Well we are going to keep it going, and I don't think we would comment on just exactly what those numbers are going to be in the forecast. But yes, we do intend to keep it moving in the right direction. And we still have our commitment to the longer term or the middle term goal of getting to the 115,000 units. I do think that we have made some additional GS&A investments that will be part of getting us to a 115,000 units and hopefully beyond that. And so, we are going to have to calibrate that in during the course of 2018, and see how that affects some of our thinking. But we have got a lot of things going on, that we believe can have a very positive impact as we look forward. Just to sort of run through them, we have got products that we think -- that are targeted to begin coming out in 2020, that should have considerably lower cost and more ability to meet the customer specifications effectively. We believe that it's not only -- that it's a broad base of lower costs. We also have programs to reduce costs over and above direct product costs, including in our manufacturing operations. And so between the products and the cost reduction, we see -- if you look out into that period, the opportunity to build volume by offering more cost effective solutions to our customers, and you couple that with the -- and the shared growth and the profit improvement that we think we can gain, particularly in certain areas of the product line, with the kind of a two year perspective on getting Bolzoni to breakeven, and we think that means, that if you look out two or three years -- I mean at Nuvera, excuse me; if you look out two or three years, you have got real opportunity. And in the meantime, if you take another couple of years with Bolzoni, we think the opportunity to continue their revenue growth and enhance profitability is very high. In the fourth quarter, Bolzoni had to deal with significant material cost increases, given the nature of their business, the attachments and a lot of steel, the cost increases come on them very fast, and their ability to pass those on right away to their customers is a little different than it is in the core Lift Truck business. But we view that as a short term kind of phasing issue and from the long term point of view, we see real revenue and profit growth opportunities in Bolzoni. So from our perspective, if we continue to work our plans in the forklift truck business in Nuvera and Bolzoni, over the next, two, three, four years, we see some real opportunities.","2assistant

"Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First, could you just discuss the bar that Bristol-Myers set in first-line melanoma with the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy? Just so we have that in context ahead of the LAG's readout ahead.
And then, second, could you provide a framework for Zeposia sales drivers in coming years in both the U.S. and ex-U.S.? Thanks very much.
","Yeah, thanks for the question, David. The way to look at it, though, as Chris mentioned earlier, there's still a large number of patients who are treated with either single agent I-O or through non-I-O regimens. So yes, O plus Y is a very important regimen, has shown very important efficacy and long-term effects and maintenance of that effect and so therefore, it becomes important. What we are now bringing is an additional, let's say, treatment potential for patients who can be treated, who have melanoma in the first-line setting with relatlimab on top of nivolumab as a single agent.
And that's the reason why we're excited about this, to be able to add to the treatment paradigm for prescribers and for patients to potentially use in the future once approved in this particular setting. One has to remember that we are also talking about the safety profile and its differentiation over here. So relatlimab plus nivolumab, therefore, becomes an important aspect of the treatment paradigm looking at the future.

"Thank you, and just last question, you know, for Greg Levin. You know, on the margins, quarter day comp in Q2, you know, was sort of that one -- mid-1 and then the trends improved but relative to your commentary, the margins or expectations, I guess you kind of ran through, you know, in terms of labor inflation and the third-party delivery fee, aside from the COD, which is very understandable, you know, on labor and other OpEx, what surprised you the most in terms of the negative impact there?","Thank you. I think the biggest surprise in Q2, if you -- and, again, I want to make sure you're talking in Q2, was, I think the avocados, you know, avocados are in our top ten of spend and that probably was a little bit more of a surprise for us than I was anticipating there. I think the success of Tri Tip, which has been really, really successful, has actually challenged our operators a little bit in regards to maybe just making sure they're prepping it and so forth so there's maybe some -- a little bit more inefficiencies around getting Tri Tip in place in Q2 and I think we've worked ourselves through that but those are probably two things going into Q2 that maybe were a little bit more challenging than maybe we were anticipating going in.","2assistant

"Okay thatâ€™s helpful. Just shifting back to the marine side, just a couple vessel specific questions, and then a higher-level view, but for the Caesar shifting to Trinidad. Can you give a little more color on the duration of the work that itâ€™s going to have down there and if thereâ€™s other follow-on opportunities that could keep it there? And then just curious on the broader marine I understand, sort of the pressure on the pipelay side and what could transpire coming off the moratorium. Owen, youâ€™ve previously talked about your revenue potential on your existing marine asset base being about $1 billion, obviously giving consideration to a sluggish Gulf and maybe to Intrepid doing P&A light well intervention work, but is that still a reasonable opportunity set given what you see in your prospect queue obviously taking into consideration the potential for a little sluggishness there on the pipelay side?"," Okay, a lot of issues there but yes, I donâ€™t think that our outlook is materially changed from anything that we said before. Iâ€™m pretty confident about the, I guess the Intrepid being our third pipelay vessel is the one that I would have the most concerned with but she is on her way down to Trinidad. I believe she is down there for at least two months and there is additional work that clients in Trinidad are talking to us about that could extend to stay. So thatâ€™s a very positive move.
The Caesar is out on its first pipelay job right now and like with all vessels, the work is going pretty slow as we train the crews and get the equipment functioning properly and everything so I donâ€™t expect a great contribution from her. But then she right after this, she also heads to Trinidad. So Trinidad is becoming a very good market for us and an alternative to the US, Gulf of Mexico. Weâ€™re also bidding work in Mexico and Brazil for primarily the Caesar. And that would open up the Intrepid to return sometime in the fourth quarter to pursue both pipelay but we really have been very successful with her this year, working her as a multi service vessel in the construction mode.
And I see that kind of a mix continuing. I think actually the construction mode is â€“ given the performance of pipelay and the margins available in the current market I actually see the alternative uses of the Intrepid probably being a little strong margin than if we left her solely in the pipelay mode for next year.","2assistant

"Okay. Just as a follow-up, like, what have you seen as a competitive response to -- with respect to you winning new business on LitePoint side?","What they tend to do is try to copy our product. We had 4 up testing, now everyone else has 4 up testing. But we have other things up our sleeve that they don't know about. So we're always, we believe, a turn ahead of them with some innovation. But they generally are fast followers. And the customers tell them, ""Do what LitePoint did. Do what LitePoint did."" But they're not starting with the best architecture to do that, so they have to make trade-offs. And often, they have higher COGS in their product. The other thing they're doing in the short term is they do what others do, they lower price. But we have much better throughput, so we tend -- that's usually not the best way for them to respond, but that's the only thing they can do in the short term.","2assistant

But this lack of floor sweeps, at the same time, what's happening is it's helping our maintenance revenue growth, if you kind of look at the dynamics of what's happened over the past 3 or 4 years.","2assistant

"Some of the programs youâ€™ve initiated, such as capacity control and the move to thinner glass are helping to improve gross margins. So Iâ€™m trying to get a sense of the sustainability of your efforts. Are we at a point of diminishing returns? Or are there further efforts to tactically improve gross margins? And conversely, are we at a point where youâ€™re now getting the premiums or the early signs of premiums, particularly as it relates to Gorilla Glass and the new applications, such as NBT. Maybe if you could help us there, please.","Mark, I assume youâ€™re talking about our corporate gross margin. And as you know, thatâ€™s always a combination of the mix of our various businesses. But what we like about our business hand right now is gross margins in telecom, specialty materials, life sciences, and environmental are actually improving. The corporate mix will obviously be dependent on the mix of the sales of those businesses, but the fact that all are improving leads me to believe that we have the potential to continue to move our year over year gross margins up. Obviously the most important thing for us remains display, and we must have moderate price declines. We had good price downward movement in Q2, being less than Q1. Weâ€™re expecting Q3 to be in a similar range, but we continue to believe thereâ€™s potential for price declines to moderate even further as the quarters unfold. So I would say weâ€™re not running into diminishing returns in terms of sustaining gross margins. Itâ€™s premature for me to talk about the premiums on our new products.","2assistant

"Just wanted to probe a little bit into the Q4 guidance because it looked -- it just struck me as very, very conservative.

"Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then I did want to follow-up on previous questions just regarding your guidance for next quarter and then for the year? As you said, a little bit different than you saw a quarter ago, but when I add the numbers the revenue I donâ€™t think consensus for fiscal 2021 is going to change much. And youâ€™re going to be looking at obviously, tougher comps at the back half when you had a really, really strong last September quarter. But it sounds like the setup for 2022, as Adam indicated is good. I guess my question is should we start thinking about a return to that 9% to 11% in revenue growth target, and in terms of margins, I know that in the past, when youâ€™ve had some really big ramp ups quarter-to-quarter, thereâ€™s been some costs and some margin headwinds. So how should we think about growth versus the margin in the mix of the business?","Yes, I think maybe Iâ€™ll start with 2022 and then thereâ€™s a couple other topics I want to hit as well, but I mean, certainly, too early to talk about 2022 and give any sort of guide or color, but I think itâ€™s setting up to be a really good year. When you look at the factors in the catalyst that I talked about earlier, I think thatâ€™s quite good. And I mean kind of backing up to 2021, I mean, I would say, well itâ€™s not 9% to 12%, it doesnâ€™t â€“ it still sets up to be a pretty good year or a growth year from a revenue standpoint. But the EPS leverage, I mean, you start to do the math on that looks pretty good. So I think thatâ€™s a compelling story for fiscal 2021.","2assistant

"Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first question has to do with inventory levels in the channel. Given the issues with the earthquake and getting production back on track and the fact that youâ€™re raising or at least holding in expectations for many of your units, can you talk a bit about where you see for cameras and inkjet laser printers and copiers, the inventory levels out there within your channel partners? And then I have a follow-up, thank you.","Generally speaking, after the earthquake we have a downward pressure to our production. So â€“ most of our product lines, including cameras, inkjet, laser printers and copiers, is in shortage in our inventories. So, I donâ€™t have any details, but generally speaking, every market, every product line has a shortage in their inventories. Thatâ€™s complete an answer?","2assistant

My other question was around new store productivity thatâ€™s been looking great. Do you think thatâ€™s a function of just better quality real estate selection and availability or do you think it's just a broader base strength that youâ€™re seeing for the whole chain in marketing and merchandising?," And I will cover this together. The last four years weâ€™ve seen improving sales and returns each year for the store portfolios the new store portfolio. And as weâ€™ve gotten bigger weâ€™ve gotten stronger which weâ€™re really excited to say, and I would tell you itâ€™s a function of a number of things.
One is weâ€™re better at executing at the store level so making sure we got the right inventory to the set up the store, making sure that we set it up well, making sure we set it up for the expected demand at the location and so on. Weâ€™re better at marketing, much better grand opening and also continue to sustain the demand in a new market.
Also I would say from a real state standpoint, theyâ€™re better location. So we become a stronger retailer where we have watched scale. Weâ€™ve got more things to look at and I would tell that allows us to be more picky. So we can â€“ when you do that you can be more picky get better locations with same or better terms as well.
And now what I like even more is we have a deeper pipeline than we've ever seen, and with the deeper pipeline you can be more selective, you can go to vibrant retail modes. You can get better quality, you can look further out, you can be thoughtful about cannibalization and that can help you be sensitive about that in timing and quarters and by years.
And so I would say Iâ€™m super pleased with our overall. The last thing I would say as we continue to be better on the analytical side as well. Weâ€™re on the third generation of our model. Our [bucks-in] model we're informing that more than ever with the data that we have in our performance with better data stats weâ€™re investing in set model.
Weâ€™re actually using some new science around that to help be even more selective and understand demand not just in the market, but how people travel to shopping nodes. And so as weâ€™ve done that we've seen stronger performance as the new store opens up.","2assistant

"Excellent. That's helpful. And then I guess, as my follow-up, this is a great year for SOC test, particularly when you think about Intel bringing in-house. Curious how you think about the moving parts for 2015. And I guess within that, would love to hear your thoughts around mobility, whether there's a pause as we shrink down to 16, 14 or whether you see re-up there. And then on the analog side, it sounds like that can continue. Would love to hear your thoughts there on sensors/microcontrollers, et cetera.","Well, I think -- so to start with analog, sensors and microcontrollers, I think there's a long-term systemic growth coming there that's both new applications driving an increase in unit volume growth for the devices. On top of that, there'll be increased test intensity because of some of the trends I cited in my remarks. So those 2 pieces I'm very optimistic about going into next year and beyond. Mobility is always volatile, and lots of things happen. Node -- you mentioned one, for example. Next year, there's likely to be a significant node shift. Now that in and of itself doesn't drive a lot of incremental test capacity, unless there's a yield issue, which did happen at the 28-nanometer node in 2012. So there's always this possibility that a node issue can create a temporary capacity surge. But it all averages out over time because once the yield issues are fixed, that capacity gets absorbed. That's what we saw in 2013. So as I look at where we are now and next year, I think looking at the balloons and anchors, it feels it's going to be about a similar kind of pattern with a systemic increase in test intensity perhaps buoying the market a little bit. So that's the color I can give you at this point.","2assistant

"So as you think into â€˜16, should we be thinking about that just so that we can calibrate expectations here, that again that will be a year of -- again assuming that your products are cleared by the FDA, of getting it to your customers, demonstrating the value and we really shouldn't for â€˜16 think about a whole lot of incremental new business? Again, I'm really just trying to understand the timeline for how you are thinking about all of this starting to gain some traction.","Larry, this is Chris. Let me take a shot at that. As we said, we believe that an achievable target for â€˜16 is in that mid-single digit range. And if half of our business plasma, emerging markets and TEG are growing in the approximately 10% range it implies that across the rest of the business will be relatively flat. So I think you should think about â€˜16 from a whole blood perspective as being a year of positioning â€“ a year of stability and a year of positioning for future growth.","2assistant

"Good afternoon guys. A few questions, and I will just round them off. The first one is, you're not the first -- there has been a few lately that have been talking about the surprising lack of promotion response, and I know you ruled out Ortega and perhaps set that aside; but concerning with the threat that connects that lack of responses or some types of promotions I am assuming not working, its how you determine to [indiscernible] for that, itâ€™s a relatively new phenomena, any sort of color around that would be helpful, because it seems to be something that's not just B&G related? And then secondly, any numbers you could put to your inefficiencies that you've had related to your rapid growth in acquisitions lately, such that we could think about, how much of this year's pain might be reversed in next year? Thank you.","Sure. We look at our inefficiencies on these acquisitions. I mean, we are really talking about distribution, and distribution means both delivery and warehousing, and we are seeing most of that inefficiency here in the first half. We are going to see some of it in the second half, but not to the level we saw in the first half. So as we look at that number that we are going against and trying to reduce going forward, it has probably incrementally cost us a little over $1 million in our warehousing, and about $2 million in our delivery costs. That's what we are trying -- I think we believe the move to warehousing will get most of that back in 2015. The distribution side is a little more challenging, because we are going up against carriers, who are pushing us harder and harder to increase rates. So that's -- one of the piece that could offset that, as we get more efficient and eat into that $2 million of over spending that we will do on an annual basis this year, we got to fight back on the rates that will eat away some of those savings we will see next year. But the warehousing should all happen. We should start really seeing the results in Houston here in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] much of those results, because that move will happen in the fourth quarter, but that should all be set for our Tennessee warehouse to be ready to go late fourth quarter, plus we will see those results as we head into the new 2015.","2assistant

Here is the next question and answer:

Question: Can you give us an update on the status of the acquisition pipeline?

Answer: Yes, we can give you an update on the status of the acquisition pipeline. As you know, we've been very active in terms of M&A activity over the past couple of years, and we continue to see opportunities to expand our portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In terms of the current pipeline, we have several deals that are in various stages of due diligence, and we expect to close a couple of those deals in the near term. In addition, we're also exploring other opportunities that we think could be a good fit for our business.assistant

"Given your stated position that you really donâ€™t want to be below one yearâ€™s cash, so by and sometime in the fourth quarter you would be roughly with one yearâ€™s cash position. So, why delay in licensing either the TNFerade program or the FMD program?","Thanks for the question. I think in this case, we never really want to below yearâ€™s cash. In this cash we have a unique opportunity to see a real robust amount of data from the program later this year and we have to make some decisions about the company at that time. So, in general would not want to get below yearâ€™s cash, if that situation happens Iâ€™m comforted by the fact that by the time we receive the data, which we are comfortable that will take place in the fourth quarter that weâ€™ll have a significant amount of time to move the business forward in whatever directions dictated by the data. So, Iâ€™m not overly concerned by that, this is inline with our expectations about how we would form the company going into that milestone.","2assistant

"Great, could you just drill down a little bit more on why you have been so successful there in a relatively short period over the last few quarters or so by product area, market segment, and are you seeing increased competition or at some point any threats out there whether it be pricing or anything else?","It's been a function of first and foremost matter of us making the integration with tech specific work and work well. Lot of credit we've picked up I think what we thought was a very strong management team with very complementary products, in some cases, where we overlap each other too much, and different strengths from a product perspective, and a customer base. You know, clearly the momentum that we are seeing recently is a function of that good integration, which was significant in the countries like India and Australia, where we both had a very large operations, and we are finding ourselves in a situation where we have got very healthy growth across IT products, and telephony products interestingly enough out of India so we are managing, because of some new products, and a new product category to do very well with that there. And clearly there is a lot of growth and expansion capability in what's called upcountry in India, which is outside the major metropolitan areas and we have a very good footprint. We are in sales offices in over 40 cities and over 30 distribution points. So that gives us a huge advantage compared to maybe some of our competitors are not as strong, or as broad and can't invest as much as we can. So a lot of vendors, and a lot of opportunities coming to us as a result of the good work and the infrastructure we have put in place there. And I wouldn't want to lose sight either of two or three other things that are happening in the region. In some of the smaller countries, they just don't get the mention nearly as much, whether that is Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand or New Zealand, we are seeing our company operate at levels better than our competitors. Again because the portfolio what we call carrier is fairly broad, the vendor community is extremely supportive of us, and the last I mentioned is really also made a big difference in the last year, year and a half from where we here lets say two years ago, three years ago, is that our China business, as we have mentioned to the Street and to all of you on calls, we went through a very significant change there two years back. And in fact pulled back on the size of the operations to get good controls and systems in place, and we put a great foundation in place with... leading that change, and since that change over the last 6 to 8 quarters, we have had excellent growth. Again, same situation as India, the breath of the portfolio increasing, the breath of country, cities sorry and territories is increasing, and that's giving us a chance to accelerate I think what we are seeing other companies do in the region.","2assistant

"Yes. That's helpful. And then on the retail side, are you seeing actually first anything else on the acquisition landscape outside of the Albertson's that you acquired?","We don't have anything today that is anything of substance to discuss. I would tell you that again at the end of the third quarter, we said that that was one of the things that we hoped would be something we could accomplish more in 2008 than we did in 2007. I think the credit markets and the market probably works in our favor that we might be able to get some things done this year that might have been a little bit more difficult to have gotten done a year ago. I think for those that have a strong balance sheet and access to capital, those companies such as Nash Finch is in the best position to be and acquire for those that might want to divest their companies and leave their business.

I would tell you though that the types of acquisitions that we would consider and that we would be looking for as I've said before, I am not looking for a home run. I just want to look for a few base hits and when we can find a strong perishable company or specialty food company or a meat business that would complement our existing business within our current geography where there is a lot of synergies, those are the kinds of deals that we would be most interested in. We don't have anything to talk about today and also I might mention that to the extent that we could determine a proper acquisition in our Military business. We have always been open to considering that but those are the kinds of things that we are looking for, something that we can manage properly, manage the risk, integrate properly and where we don't bet the ranch on one single deal. So that is about the best I can tell you Mark regarding that.","1assistant

"Thanks, JPMorgan. I want to follow up on the timing question, Neil. And reflecting back a few months ago, I guess, February, March time frame, you re-upped Steve's contract and added a three-year retention package, which frankly, was just kind of exchanging value for his option to leave around this time of the year, given the changes of control costs. So I just want to follow up and really understand the timing, and what's really changed versus six or seven months ago?","I think, as I said, it's really a coincidence. The contract discussions got started a while back, given the BC Partners investment and the change in control issued. They only got signed in the first quarter, so you're really looking at a time period there, where we've had almost nine to 10 months from the time the discussion started about changing the contract or renewing the contract with the effective event that we have this week. So it was just one of these things, where as I said earlier, there's never a good time to make a change. Both sides decided that it was appropriate at this point. And again, we want to say, it had nothing to do with the SEC issue. It was unfortunate that it's come out that way, but that's not the facts.","1assistant

" Because early on, you said the year or fiscal year is very lumpy, which I understand, customer concentration. But the year has progressed in line with what you were expecting in January. But when I look at your shipment guide, even for December, even if I put in more than $800 million, it would give me calendar year shipment down 3%.

" That's great color. And perhaps the last one for me, if you have a bit lower tax rate in 2018 and hopefully, [indiscernible] cash flow in general from improving business trends, you know with these tax savings, with the ability to bring cash back to the United States, have you ever -- as to what you might do with any outsized cash flow going forward? Is there a way you can use it to kind of speed up the development with Nuvera at all perhaps, or is there a way to even do the kind of -- get that going faster, because I am getting the sense too, it's kind of like, maybe that there are some impatient investors out there? Thanks."," Well you know, there could be impatient investors for sure. We really can't manage the cycle around that in our individual businesses. And I think that the only fair answer to your question, with regard to Nuvera is that, we believe we are going forward in the prudent way, step by step, carefully orchestrated on in the following way, to expand the battery box replacement product line, product by product. Second, to have for each individual battery box, a time phase scheduled cost reductions, which reflects our anticipation for engineering changes and supplier cost reductions to the components that we are using, so that we drive the cost of the components down, and then get the value of volume purchasing and volume manufacturing. That's not really a process that lends itself to speeding up any more than we are. We want to be very careful. We want to ensure that as our products come online, that we have the reliability and quality that the Hyster and Yale products stand for, and to be the leader in the industry in that regard. So that's kind of the Nuvera story. But more broadly, you know, our company has not -- by, it doesn't have a character of being a capital allocator. Our position is, we are going to do what is prudently and appropriate necessary to build value over the long term in each one of our businesses. And in that regard, certainly, the new tax law has couple of impacts, it will help us generate cash, which may pay down debt and give us more flexibility over the long term, to do other things that can benefit the business. But most importantly, in my judgment, this tax reform gives us a level playing field on an after-tax basis with our global competitors. They have not faced many years, the tax regime that we faced. So it's very difficult for us to make the same kinds of investments and have an expected comparable reward. So this levels the playing field around the world, and we think that's going to be beneficial from a competitive point of view, and that's really the most important piece of that, that I would emphasize. As far as the location of our capital is concerned, we will simply have it where think it's the best place to have it from a business point of view. We are not moving it back, just because the rules change, we will try to run our business as we always have in the most prudent kind of way, and we will. Certainly, Ken and his finance team will give thoughtful consideration to the implications of the new tax regime to where debt and equity need to be, to properly capitalize each of our businesses around the world. And Ken, I would guess that simply changes to some degree, as we look forward, because of the nature of both the global tax rules, but also the rules that are associated with making sure that people don't gain those tax rules. So we have some thinking to do. We will work our way through it, and probably be in a better position to comment in more detail, after the federal government gives us some regulatory guidelines. And I think it's fair to say, nobody is quite sure what the story is, is that right?","2assistant

"Got it. Okay. I certainly appreciate all the color, but, I guess, from our perspective -- and I think anyone on this call is actually able to kind of quantify what an extra 1 million ton charge rate actually means in terms of marginal cash sales. So it would be helpful if we could get a little bit of guidance on that at some point in the future. The next question I had was just on the distributable cash flows. Back at the Strategy Day, you've indicated that the dropdowns would increase distributable cash flow by about $38 million on a pre-financing basis. The number you've given today is $23 million. Is the difference between the 2, being $15 million, purely the financing costs? In other words, it is the underlying apples-to-apples?","Yes, the difference is financing costs.","1assistant

"Couple of quick things it seems like that when I read the results and kind of see what you guys are highlighting as whatâ€™s going on. It seems to me that it's pretty clear that the one growth area of the digital signage I think we are all aware that. Is everything else around digital signage, kind of just trying to maintain and create revenue and some decent margin, but do you guys see any kind of growth other places as I said to the signage that you are relatively excited about. And second part of my question and then I will slip in, is as far as the home theatre goes, any traction there and I know it seems like there is not, but I was just wondering where the home theatre business is right now an what where we see that going forward?","Okay. So, clearly digital signage does offer a lot of growth opportunities in several of the other product line we are in more of maintain our position. Although we have in this year seen some pretty nice growth in the desktop monitor and touch monitor side of our business. And we see a few opportunities there as touch interactivity becomes a bigger part of the user interface and the potential that has new operating systems from Microsoft come out that there may be more opportunities there. So, there is some potential for opportunity there but most of our views on growth or in digital signage and kind of keep most of the rest of the portfolio either in the flattish or modest growth has been our goal. As it relates to the home theatre business continues to be a very challenging market space, and we see revenues lower than what we saw a year ago, they seem to have kind of flattened over the recent pass just what we are seeing now. And we see customer still buying products but nowhere near at the rate that they were a year ago. And I think we have seen in general a bit of a step down in price on average whereas a year or two or three ago people might have been spending a little bit more per projector or per home theatre construction project thatâ€™s spending a little bit less going for maybe some lower cost products to outfit their solutions. So, we donâ€™t see that improving a whole lot n so we are doing what we can to make sure that we are as much in control of what we need to do from expense standpoint given that revenue level.","2assistant

"Okay, and just lastly regarding Asia, do you still have a strong presence in the components, and processors, and other PC components, and how is that business doing?","We do. It's doing well in probably the countries like China and India where there is still a fairly large wide box market, but I would say more of our growth is coming from finished systems whether that's laptops who have become very competitive on a worldwide level from the major OEM's or in networking, even software is starting to grow at healthier pace than we would have seen a few years ago as more, and more companies comfortable with buying software as opposed to coping it.

We are not dealing with thousands of customers. We are dealing with hundreds. And when you work to get your centers up and running to 85%, 90% you are pretty dependent on what's happening with that portfolio of clients. So it's suddenly, it's got a downturn. I mean, it does have fits and stats. So even with our capacity utilization, Bill, we would love when we are talking about going to get to 85%, but the perfect scenario is that every country that you are operating is at 85. That is what we try to do but it typically isn't the way it happens. It is usually a little more lumpy, like you might get to 90% in one part, you may be sitting at 65% like we were in the U.S. So that's the characteristic of the business. I think you guys, years ago. U.S. had been lumpy. it continues to the lumpy.","2assistant

"Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions from me if I could. First one on the funnel expansion, you mentioned some decisions by some customers to move to outsourcing. Could you expand on what drove that decision? Whether it was something that was already in the works or maybe if there was a change in thinking due to circumstances, and then I had to follow-up?","Yes. This is Steve. In some of these challenging times, I think customers do question their supply chain strategies more. And so I think the conversations weâ€™re having right now are things that customers were considering, but I think the COVID situation is pushing them to move a little bit quicker.

"And how should we be thinking about the â€“ obviously youâ€™ve done the internal studies to see â€“ to make the decisions that you needed to make with respect to the upcoming restructuring, but how susceptible are the other sub-segments of your business, so the components business, to future restructuring?","Well, first of all, as Bob mentioned earlier, we do a lot of reviews on all our businesses on a quarterly basis. We believe that what we have today, after this transformation â€“ and really this transformation has been planned for a long, long time â€“ we always review it. We made a major commitment, and with the investments in China, we got basically a huge new factory there. It just didnâ€™t make sense for us to have two similar type of factories, one in Malaysia and one in China, when we feel that one can provide the solution. And also, I think itâ€™s important to understand type of product that we build; these are really â€“ weâ€™re driving to advance printed circuit boards that we can compete on some of these things even from North America. So weâ€™ve been investing heavily in our North American operations that provide for a unique technology. So we feel comfortable with what we have today. Weâ€™ve be tuning these things up. Most important for us right now is really the growth of these. And I believe we need some demand to improve. But as that demand comes, I think operationally weâ€™re ready to execute.","2assistant

Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your AllianceRx Walgreens Prime specialty solutions business versus the Shields Health Solutions business? And what is your strategy going forward for bringing in the specialty revenues to the company?,"Sure. Hi Peter, it's Alex here. Yes, I think that they are set at the moment. So, let me deal with our investment in Shields to start with that. They really walk with health systems to enable the health system to take better care of the patients as they go back into community.We have a number of local assets both in hospital systems and also specialty pharmacies where we want to make sure that working with the local health system, we can help them to service and take care of that patient more directly. So it's early days, but that's the model there. Really it's a community model.Our work with AllianceRX is really about the central model in the mean, and of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime which are the Blues and particularly the financial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over two years ago. And the business is now performing from an operational point of view very well, but clearly the market is changing and we're looking forward to how we can of course accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward.So if you think of them as two separate areas at this stage, and of course, we recognize the incredible importance of specialty and the new drugs in the marketplace in the years ahead, I think 50% of the value of medication will be in specialty within three years. So of course, we're working very hard on both the individual piece, I've mentioned, but also how we combine the Walgreens brand and all of our assets over time to create a more powerful specialty model with our -- partners.","1assistant

"The new DC in Southern Cal, I know you guys are closed a few years ago. I just don't know if this is just - this is now getting bigger so you need it now. Is there anything different you're doing with that DC versus what may have not yet previously that's my only question? Thanks so much.","Yes. Itâ€™s really kind of an investment. I think about it as an investment into the outdoor furniture and special order business. So itâ€™s architected for those two businesses, design for those two businesses, and building to leverage those two business and run them in a more focused way to kind of get better customer experience, grow those businesses, and services business is better. So before we just had a full DC in Southern California with kind of redundant DCs in Northern and Southern California, yes. But each have things like for example all that - most of our outdoor furniture is coming out of - teak is coming out of Indonesia and metal furniture coming out of different parts of Asia, Vietnam, China and things like that. So every major container ship that's coming in is first stopping in Southern California and then going up to Oakland - the port of Oakland. So you pick up seven days immediately right there and then just the way we're going to handle and process thought crosstalk businesses, this is speed to the consumer and then if you think about the outdoor furniture business Southern California is our largest outdoor furniture market by far. And then the southern states are a lot of our strongest very, very logical. So the ability to get the goods delivers faster in the biggest markets and hit the southern states faster and think about the trucking lines and our businesses - the reason we can do this not everybody can do this is our businesses are really big, right? I think these are - like, our outdoor furniture businesses are real businesses - I mean I think our outdoor furniture business is bigger than some of our biggest competitors today at the high end, right? I think some of the - by far but theyâ€™re just outdoor against their entire business. Thatâ€™s it. Like, weâ€™re having an internal conversation here. I think about, like - you might think about, like, a higher quality national brand or something like that. So itâ€™s a real business, right? Thatâ€™s the great thing about starting to have scale like this. You can - it allow you to kind of segment and focus on businesses in a very unique way and optimize businesses like you only ran that business. And then if you think about the special order business, itâ€™s a completely different business, got a different model. And how do we run that business at a much more efficient way, better customer service, faster delivery, things like that? So it's really an investment. We've been talking about this internally for a long time, investing into those two businesses.","2assistant

"I mean, I may have missed it, but is that driving the margin drop down and the payments year-over-year, payments margin?
","Yes, that's correct. That's been going on all year end, and that's really where a lot of our investment as a company is focused. And Darrin, I think earlier I addressed this question, but the issue around most of our growth comes through headcount, which is expensed. And if you look back, we were investing in seven or eight or nine different things here that are very critical to us and will help our growth rate as we get into '11 and '12 and '13. So they're critical things, and we're very excited about.","2assistant

"And finally, Steve, can you quickly just clarify the guidance? Is R&D higher than what you thought 90 days ago rolled into the guidance? And taxes as well, if you can clarify, is that higher in your expectation?","No, Joe, R&D is generally in line with the original guidance and the tax rate, with it increasing in the remainder of the year, and the tax rate is consistent with the guidance with the exception of the R&D tax credit, which, from a non-GAAP basis, we did not bring into Q1. But for our full year, non-GAAP tax rate, we're assuming that, that does get approved for 2014. If that is the case, we'll recognize in the quarter in which it was approved.","2assistant

"I just want to first start on the macro commentary. The sense is that while it looks like the results arenâ€™t really seeing any pressure at this point, the tone sounded like you could be seeing a little bit of incremental either elongated sales cycles or decision cycles. Can you elaborate on what youâ€™re seeing just in the current environment and maybe what trends have looked like thus far in to the month of July?","We continue to see good activity in July as weâ€™re a couple of weeks in to the quarter. So, we havenâ€™t noticed any significant change from how we exited the second quarter. I think our commentary as it relates to the macro environment is just a reflection of caution out there and scrutiny of deals. I wouldnâ€™t say that deals from my perspective are being any more or less scrutinized than what weâ€™ve seen earlier in the year but that continues to be a variable that you have to factor in as you look across the pipeline of opportunities and as you think about what expectations and performance results you can drive. So, I think we continue to see an environment that is pretty similar to the environment that weâ€™ve been living in throughout the first half of this year. Obviously, thatâ€™s a view of the world on July 16th, things can change in a way thatâ€™s more adverse to what our opportunities are but, thatâ€™s what we see today.
And as I look across the pipeline throughout the rest of the quarter, the back half of the year, we have, as weâ€™ve seen in previous quarters, see some projects that may have been delayed or maybe decreased in amount due to some of these external considerations. And, on the other side weâ€™re seeing projects that maybe are getting accelerated relative to original expectations or being increased based on compelling technologies that can drive significant ROI opportunities for our customers. So, longwinded way of saying it, itâ€™s counter bailing, itâ€™s balancing right now both ways. I donâ€™t see a marked change today from what weâ€™ve seen earlier in the year.","2assistant

"Okay, Q4000 if I recall correctly was fairly well booked maybe even into, through the end of this year and the next year before the BP situation, obviously working for BP now for a while. Can you maybe share the status of some of the other work you were supposed to be working on right now? Or are people, youâ€™re going to get some cancellations there or do you think that some of that continues to get extended?","Jim, let me take that. Yes, the Q4000 was fully booked for BP Macondo throughout 2010 and somewhat into 2011. And for the most part its involvement in the Macondo situation is only extending that backlog and increasing the backlog. There has been a job, a small job that was cancelled but aside from that mainly the work that she had in backlog has just been pushed to the right.

"Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Could I ask a question here on the App Store? Is there any additional color you can give even directionally on the mix between paid and free downloads on the App Store overall, any additional color between the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and then I had a quick follow-up, if I could?","Bill, this is Tim. I would add to that a couple of things. One, one of the keys behind the growth of the iPod this quarter despite the economic environment was that the iPod Touch more than doubled year-over-year. So, it was a tremendous result and as Peter mentioned earlier in his remarks, the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch is now about 37 million units and so, it provides an enormous platform for developers to develop on and with the â€“ with our recent SDK changes the developers are working on now, I think it just unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else.","1assistant

"I guess on the topic of margins, I mean, you put up a nice margin expansion, 70 basis points over last year. And I think that was on revenue growth of about 1.5%. When we consider your guidance of 3% to 4%, and we also note that about 60% of your revenues are transaction processing-driven, like you said, scalable. I mean, I would have expected to see more than 50 basis points margin upside just given the revenue pick up. So that's I guess why I'm trying to figure out, understanding why it wouldn't be more than 50 basis points. Is it just because of the payments growth initiatives?","Darrin, I would say first of all, and this maybe how we talk about this, I would accentuate the 'at least' part of that. You said at least 50 basis points. We're not saying nor are we saying it will be 50. Try to have me say that again. It's just kind of our normal guidance, we've now just adopted it. So it's at least 50 basis points. So I would not necessarily use 50 basis points as the right answer.","2assistant

"Great, thanks. Good morning. So with Walmart announcing a big push in the primary care clinical services and a perception among some investors that Walmart may be offering these services at lower prices than the competition, I guess I'm just curious to hear your high-level thoughts on whether this may influence your pricing or marketing strategy and/or the timing of rollout of your own clinical services strategy at Walgreens over the next couple of years.And then on the plus side of this, could the -- just the notion of greater visibility overall on primary care offerings in the traditional retail setting maybe be a net positive for Walgreens and really all the players at this early stage? Thanks.","Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, we think that it's a good move for retail to be involved in health care as that happens in a place like Walmart in 206 huge successful company and they do it well then we think that'll help us because, we've got a great brand. We think, we've got strong, better community locations. And we've got more focus on pharmacy there and more focus on health care relationships. So, overall, we think that's going to be an advantage to us. And we'll continue with our own strategy, developing and investing in the way that James and I have described this morning.","2assistant

"Okay. Then just lastly, if you adjust for currency, you're mix versus the midpoint was only $3.5 million, but the increase in the operating loss was double. So the difference there is the increase investments on the enterprise. Is that the way we should look at that?","So the impact of the currency has a big negative effect on our operating income because the majority of our cost certainly manufacturing we saw in North America revenue is reported international.

"Okay. And then, I guess, just to follow up here on the buy rate on some of your slides. You're saying the buy rate this year for SOC is only about 1%, which is significantly below where it was in '10, '11 and '12. Did something happen industry-wide? Or is it just dynamics of a single year?","Well, I think there's one factor that needs to be put in there. So yes, it's up this year from last year. It will be up 1%-plus. But the buy rate in the past had effect of some large microprocessor companies were buying significant commercial capacity. They tend, at this point, to move in-house. And so that was in the commercial market numbers in '10, '11, '12, and it's out of the commercial market numbers that you look at in '13, '14 and beyond. So if you -- and that could be on the order of several hundred million dollars of buying. So if you neutralize that effect of shifting from commercial to in-house, I think you would find it's back not quite to that 1.3% level, but it's getting back there.","2assistant

"Hi, I would like to ask you a couple of questions about the NETosis assays. So you have got the one COVID-19 study where you have been collecting these material samples? Have you submitted that data yet for a pre-conference? And if so, which conference, would it be presented at?","Yes. So we have gotten a couple of different paths, we tried to do a big sort of study. And that is been very tough to get off the ground, because everyone quite naturally is concerned with getting their sick well, in the emergency wards. So collecting serial samples and not a complicated trial. But it is obviously something which takes a lot of attention away from, a lot of them have been obviously extremely busy, especially in London in the last few months. So we have been working with, through a few different networks, they have been incredibly good people in the COVID. And so space. I guess the hospitals, we talked about a bit, but very, very large hospitals, the best ones in London and some of the best in the world for COVID work. They have submitted to conferences, I believe the next one, they tend to be two or three months ahead. That is the only problem with when you do it like this. They do it through publication, which is good. I mean, it means they are very happy with the data. And they are very comfortable, but just takes a little more time to conferences donâ€™t happen the next week from when the data comes out. But the next one is July. And we have, as I said a bunch more out there. So I would see a steady stream of them coming through the rest of this year, both in the pig animal model for sepsis therapy and the human model also in sepsis, also in COVID. And I canâ€™t give you the details now. But there is several other areas of NETosis where we have been very active in supporting groups who have research going in that field with providing our assays and our knowledge of NETosis to see how it goes with them. So the first one is, I guess it is been over a month away. And there is a large range of them coming through the year. And I think we have been extremely encouraged with the work that we have been doing with it with our partners who are world renowned specialists in COVID and sepsis and in emergencies. And we are also attempting to now get the size we needed for studies, which can then become the regulatory work for CE mark, which again, at the studies is the delay, once we have that a CE mark can actually happen quite quickly because our platform is so well developed. It is a matter of small number of months once we have the population at run. And as I discussed with Kyle, particularly with sepsis, you can get large numbers very quickly, summer, winter, rain or shine, there is always sepsis in a hospital. So I couldnâ€™t be more happy or excited with the way it is going our platform. We have been shipping kits to very busy, very independent people. And the feedback we have got has been nothing short of excellent in every case, not only in the quality of our assay, but how well it is at doing different things with regard to the NETosis. And as I said, not just the diagnostic, but also potentially, as a companion diagnostic or even patient selection for treatments for clearing out of nets. So potentially a really, really big market and something we are very excited about. And there will be a lot of data through the year. Does that answer your question Bruce?","1assistant

"And I'll also add my congrats on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe two questions from me, one to start off, we saw a nice performance down the MedSurg business and throughout medical. There's a lot of new product launches going on here, so I just would like to get a sense of what the key drivers are? How the ProCuity Bed launch is going and what you're seeing in terms of the capital equipment, health of the market out there?","Hey Robbie, it is Preston. Just in terms of capital overall and we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment and if we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical as you'd said and also of course with our Mako technology. As it pertains specifically to Medical, so obviously we have the ProCuity Bed which I'll talk about in just a second, but we also have really strong performances out of our emergency care business. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well and so that continues to be very strong and it's just been an uptick there really in the in the U.S. and outside the U.S.

With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers, and we're starting to see building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and then starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well. So we really expect that ProCuity is going to continue to be a driver for Medical really for the remainder of this year and as we go into next.","2assistant

"Okay. And last one from me, are you seen any changes in terms of new business on the billing type, either to more outcomes oriented or different models where you take on a little bit more of the risk?","Yes. There is definitely interest in that merging. I can tell you personally we are interested in that. I don't know if it's something that is going to become really broad-based and the norm. To get the outcome-based billing, it does require the client to come and give over to you certain control and trust that maybe they are not comfortable with. That fact alone I think will make it to where it will just become a component of the market. I don't know what percent. I could see it to maybe 20% of our portfolio would move into that way. And it's something we are interested in because we are operating with some of those outcome-based billing models today and they have proven to be quite successful. So we would like to get more of them.","2assistant

" Good morning. Thank you. I have two questions. I promise to be quick.
First, you mentioned that retail inventory is down in most markets. Where was it up, and by how much and why? And then I have a follow-up, please."," Sure. Retail inventory is up a little bit with our Wizards business, and it's up a little bit in our games business. But these are very, very small increases. I would say, overall, inventory is either kind of in line with a year ago or slightly below.
And it's just where we have increasing demand and sales.","2assistant

"Hello. Thank you. I wanted to return to Zeposia, please. I mean, MS is a very tough market to be launching in Q2 COVID.
I'm just wondering which patients are starting on Zeposia and do you expect that to evolve? And then, on the UC indication, are you anticipating an AdCom? And could you update us on how you're preparing for launch? Thank you.
","Sure. Let me start, and then, I can maybe turn it over to Samit for the AdCom question. So very happy with the performance of Zeposia in MS, particularly as you point out, in light of the COVID environment. This was, as we had talked about last year, a market that was hit by COVID in terms of new patient volume being down.
And obviously, this is a market that we are entering into relatively new for BMS. And so at the end of last year, we spent a considerable amount of time making sure we were engaging with customers in many cases for the first time. And then, so our focus was continuing to do a few things. First, it was making sure that we were selling the profile for this, what we believe and clearly is being demonstrated in the data, No.
1 SP in this market. We've seen very good uptake in terms of written prescriptions here. Obviously, the dynamic pool of MS is relatively small. And we've seen most of the business at this point coming from switch patients, and we're continuing to get an increase in new patients who are coming onboard as well.
So we're very happy with that. And we would expect that to continue to evolve over time. And then, obviously, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, a big focus for us has been making sure that we continue to convert those written scripts into commercial dispense and ensuring a very smooth journey for patients in this market, and we've had a great acceleration there. So excited about what we're seeing so far, and we think we are on a very good trajectory for Zeposia in MS in the U.S.
Samit?

"Got it. And also, Charlie, if I could just quickly verify, next year's constant currency growth rate would be better than the reported growth that you're assuming based on your currency? And also, should we expect billings to grow roughly in line with revenues mix here?","Okay. Yes, on a constant currency basis, the guidance would be higher because the yen has weakened 15%, the guidance rate that I gave. So that is a fair assumption.

"Right, okay. Third and final question was just on your guidance on tonnage. The change from 4.3 million to 4.2 million tons, is really pretty modest, I guess, in terms of what we're seeing in the steel industry at the moment with all of the sort of iron ore and raw materials issues that they're having. Could you talk a little bit about the underlying blast furnace utilization numbers that are embedded into your full year production guidance?","So, interestingly, obviously, the blast furnaces have been affected by iron ore shortages, Lake Superior logistics, I've learned all sort of things about icebreaking barges. And let's face it, it's been a -- the winter has affected our customers in a pretty significant way. Interestingly, relative to the demand for our coke, there's been no desire on the part of our customers for us to dial back production. On the contrary, frankly, we wish we could've produced more from -- particularly from Indiana Harbor. So relative -- I can't really comment on overall blast furnace utilization as we go into 2014, my crystal ball is not that good. If you look at order books, and I do -- we do talk to our customers, their order books are strong, they would prefer to be running more. And I think if they get through the disruptions of the winter and get iron ore delivery more normalized, they want to run their blast furnaces at higher utilization rates and they're going to be pulling on our coke. So we don't really think -- we don't -- if we look out the rest of the year, we don't see demand constraints hitting anything.","2assistant

"Okay. And as you kind of analyze your trends so far this quarter and you're able to look back to last year, is there any reason to believe that your trend will improve throughout the quarter? Is there any reason to believe that the California market will begin to perform more in line with the rest of the system or should we all be assuming flat trends for the quarter is the base case to think about?","Brian, I don't know if we have an exact answer for you. I mean, when we look at our numbers we were somewhat surprised because there's actually fairly -- fairly -- it was a fairly quick change in the sales trends, meaning, we finished P6, let's just call it the mid-2's and every week in P6 was pretty solid. We thought the first week, and I do still believe the first week is a little bit of a July 4th flip from that standpoint, but as we started looking at some of our numbers, we did notice last year that we had the Miramar fires down in the San Diego area and that impacted a lot of our San Diego restaurants. We had a Madera fire, we had a Yucaipa fire out in -- Empire [ph] hitting some of our restaurants. So, I think as -- as we get through that, that should be cause for an -- an improvement in our California restaurants but, as we say, and we always say this kind of on the calls, we kind of give you the information that we have to-date and I know that sounds like sometimes not enough but even as we were looking at our business in June, we weren't expecting all of the sudden it to change from what we saw, literally the last week of June, to what we've seen the first couple of weeks of July.So, you know, I'm planning that it's going to improve and I think we've got good initiatives and things we like in our business from that standpoint. We feel very comfortable at least three weeks in how the rest of our portfolio is doing. We're -- we like the strength that we continue to see in those markets. As we said, that would be up in the mid-2% range, that's including in Texas, Florida, Ohio, etc. It's just California has come out of the gate a little bit softer here and as we went through and tried to analyze it and isolate it down, those are the things that we've seen a little bit softer in the Bay area. We're going over against some high comp sales of a year ago related to some fires and then as we've mentioned on the call, maybe while still growing in healthy double digits, not having quite as strong a tailwind maybe as third-party delivery was a year ago but still a tailwind for us.","1assistant

"So Mike, does that suggest that -- so as these workloads really get granular, right, so someone building a system just to do lead scoring for Marketo or sales scoring just for stuff on salesforce.com or something along those lines or revenue optimization in a very specific vertical for a specific set of companies, does it mean that you guys need to potentially think about heading towards the front-end applications? You've always had sort of -- I've got a telco data warehouse in the logical model, but you've never stepped in too much into the pure sort of application-based space. Does it make sense for you guys to head in that direction, potentially leveraging Hadoop or Aster underneath for sort of a more flexible environment or even sort of the dumbed-down appliance-type database, but more vertical-specific applications that address a business case as opposed a broad-based IDW?","Well, our focus is on the analytics portion of that, and we do that with Hadoop, as well as with Aster and with -- in addition to other things to provide the analytics that support many of these different analytical -- or many of these applications, if you will. And we see a huge opportunity around the analytics for all the, if you will, specialized types of applications. Now the one place where we've gotten out into application software is with our integrated marketing cloud solution because if we had to pick a subject area for analytics and new types of analytics over the next several years, marketing would be a subject area where there's lots -- a broader amount of analytics that can be had as opposed to some of these point solutions, specific applications that you just mentioned. So our focus is on the analytics of everything, of all data from all the various sources and applications that are out there, except for in the area of marketing, where we're going deep on marketing applications and the analytics that go with it.","2assistant

" Yeah. I appreciate that. I mean, that's what I am really struggling with here, because if I am looking on the face of it, it looks like the business is in a really good shape. I mean, your orders are looking good, your backlog is looking good, the price you have gotten overall in the quarter and the Q is looking pretty good. And I am looking at your guidance, and you are essentially saying that you are going to have material headwinds that hamper your profitability in the front half of 2018. This is not just you, this is happening broadly in machinery. I am trying to understand, what is the extent to which material costs are hurting you, and what can you pass-through with costs?"," The other thing that's happening is, is that we are increasing our operating expenses, as we implement further reinforcements to the industry share gain and industry selling efforts that we are putting in place. We view that as more of an investment than expense, but it shows up as an expense, and once we get that in place, we expect that over the course of 2017-2018, we expect it to level off. But we are still in a position, we are prepared to invest in these programs that we think can really drive our long term position. So there is quite a bit of that going on in our overall structure, particularly on the operating expense line.","1assistant

"Hi, guys. This is Roy in for Charles. A couple of quick questions. I wondered if you could go into maybe, I don't know, detail but describe the process with Roche and how's that proceeding? The legal proceedings?","Sure. So as you're well aware, we have an action filed in State Court in Nevada. It's been pending for a little while. We're anticipating that discovery will be ongoing for several more months. After that, there's typically some motions called motions for summary judgment to try and simplify the case. The trial date is currently set for October of 2013 and probably the only caution I would add is the trial dates that far out because it has a tendency to flip sometimes. We don't know that's going to happen, but it does have a tendency to slip. And usually it's not in, it's usually out.","2assistant

Okay. Got it. And then it sounded like from the very beginning of your opening remarks that the slowdown started about half way through the quarter and then obviously thereâ€™s bounce back in October. Was there anything specific you was feel was behind that? And then also was it timing related with selling days or anything like that?," We really didnâ€™t see anything specific. We obviously did look and try to understand and there really wasnâ€™t anything specific other than the matters we sort of mentioned and then youâ€™ve seen the pickup in October. We just havenâ€™t seen it and â€“ basically for us it was obviously we initially looked at it and said â€“ looked at directionally but basically once we saw the numbers coming back in October, that obviously gave us a lot more comfort. But basically we think that you go back and you take into account the chemical issue which was an unexpected issue and the currency where it is. I mean the business is doing much better as I indicated, the sales are up and the numbers are up in local currencies, up over 60%. So again, itâ€™s as if the factor -- all these factors at the time just really shaved the top.","2assistant

"So Dave, just back to the industry question for a minute on the promotional effectiveness, have you seen, I guess in your experience, an environment around promotional effectiveness like this before? And if so, was it transitory and what kind of got it moving in the right direction?","Andrew, there is a lot of unique circumstances going on here right now. I think it's unusual, it's unusual, and I think the promotional phenomenon if you will, I think is partly because, you already promote the brands that are sensitive to promotion. So the question, well how much additional promotion are you going to move the needle -- how much you're going to move the needle by doing the additional promotion on a brand, that you already are putting a decent amount of money against. P&M for instance, is a highly promotional category, I think upwards of 80% of the volume at certain times of the year sells on promotion. How much are you going to move the needle by doing even more promotion? So I think there is that factor, and then putting promotional money against brands that aren't promotionally sensitive, you're obviously going to be very challenged to suddenly get a consumer response when you do the promotion. So I don't know that itâ€™s a really good weapon in a lot of cases.","1assistant

"Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of questions please. First, while your North American revenue growth was better than the reported number after taking account the change in the accounting for warranty sales, what percent year-over-year is a bit closer than what you have been seeing more recently. Can you tell us if there is anything company specific that's causing the slowdown, is it more of a function of the macro environment?","We believe it's probably more a function of the overall macro environment. As I said before Min, we have seen relative softness in the Government and large corporate segments but we have seen relative strength as well in our retail business and also in our specialty units in the Avid division and in the data capture point of sale division as well. But I do believe that overall we are doing fairly well in the market, kind of maintaining our share there but it is a bit spotty in demand overall.","2assistant

"Okay, but I guess, so you havenâ€™t necessarily seen more demand for the vessel. Itâ€™s just youâ€™ve had an opportunity to prove the vessel out, the value of the Q4000 here on this Macondo well.","Well I think the clients are understanding that value of the Q4000 like we said we were booked before pretty, with a great backlog. Weâ€™ve just seeing no deterioration of that and therefore this period of Macondo is just been sort of adding backlog. So weâ€™re looking really strong going forward, I might add, if the moratorium â€“ it depends what happens with the rigs if the rigs start leaving the Gulf of Mexico then when the moratorium is lifted there is going to be a rather than an oversupply there is going to be an undersupply of rigs which would benefit us greatly.","2assistant

"Okay, super. And then following up in slightly more detail on the plain packaging situation in Australia. Is it fair to expect that the Senate does pass both bills in November? And then has PMI selected and started the formation of the arbitration tribunal at this point?","Well, the vote in the Senate hasn't taken place. We will see when it takes place. As the Health Minister herself has said, it might -- or that probably will lead to a delay in the implementation date. We are, of course, ramping up the legal cases that, as we said, we will vigorously pursue all the avenues, the bilateral investment treaty case but also other avenues, domestic and you name it. So we are, of course, in full swing to be ready for this situation.","1assistant

"Okay. Got you. And also in the lower volume outlook you have for 2018 in Print, aside from the industry volume declines, are you still adjusting some of your client base going forward as well?","Yeah, we are doing two things, Judy. We're adjusting the client base for high-risk accounts, primarily around debt. It doesn't do anything good to sell to them if they don't pay us, simplistically, and so we're more aggressively managing that. And for a number of reasons, we think the industry is not getting healthier and with price increases from manufacturers coming more and more into play, there could be even greater risk. So we're trying to be proactive to address that. So that could have impact on revenues.
The other thing that we are also adjusting is, we're making some choices on the product portfolio as well. For example, we are in the wide format space, print wide format print. And in the last couple of weeks, we announced that we were exiting the plastic portion or the non-paper portion of wide format and that will put some pressure on the top line as well. Now, the reason we're doing that is because we don't believe that we have the right to win in that space, whereas in the paper space for wide format, we do believe we do. And so, it's a strategic choice that we made. So it's a choice around both optimizing the product portfolio to get it to a sweet spot, as well as making customer choices to derisk the business.","2assistant

"Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question, fitting in just to find me. Just two, if I may. Just wanna confirm that the -- on Eliquis, the $160 million true-up was actually -- was, indeed, a tailwind and not a headwind.
And then, finally, just on BD, test question for Giovanni, if I can. I noticed you have a somewhat new vertical for BMS and so far, as having neuroscience. As you think about BD, what are the areas that you'll be looking to invest in? And roughly, how much are you looking to deploy on an annual basis for the next few years?
","Yeah, thanks, Navin. So let me just say very quickly. Yes, you are right. It is a tailwind, the $160 million, with respect to business development.
Actually, what we are doing, what our teams are doing in neuroscience is really interesting. We, obviously, over the last few years, built a very innovative model where through a network of partnerships primarily, a small team at BMS has been very successful in advancing an early portfolio that looks quite compelling at this point. So not a large area of focus from a sort of late-stage development for us yet, but an emerging franchise that could be important in the future. As I said earlier, we are going to be looking at continuing to strengthen our portfolio depending on, obviously, the assets that we look at and are available across all of the areas where we have expertise.
We haven't really given a target in terms of spend per year, but we've made it very clear that this is the No. 1 priority in terms of capital allocation strategy. The acquisition of MyoKardia last year is a really good example of the type of focus we want to continue to have going forward as a company. And I'll remind you, we have tremendous financial flexibility to be able to invest in the right opportunities and in the right science.
So with that, I would like to thank all of you for joining us today as we discuss this quarter. We delivered strong results consistent with our strategy. We've continued to grow revenue, execute on our launches and advance the pipeline. I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished so far this year, including so many of the important milestones that have been discussed during the call.
And as always, our team will be able to answer further questions you may have during the course of the day and the rest of the week. So have a good day. And thanks again to all of you for participating.

"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about some of the strategic review as you analyze some of the different business units and some of the assets that you may be able to sell, like some of the real estate. I guess, is there any ability to quantify for us the kinds of bids or interest level that may be out there and any more ability to talk about timing with which you might be able to address some of this?","Hi, this is Mary. Thanks for the question, Brad. I would say, at this point no, weâ€™re not in a position to put specific numbers to you know the businesses and all that. I will say, we are very actively engaged in the process, and weâ€™ve had a number of inbound interests on some of our portfolio companies, and so weâ€™re taking a look at those, we are evaluating that, weâ€™re going through the normal process that you would go through to do that, and so when we have something to report that actually turns into you know a potential transaction, weâ€™ll certainly come forward with that. But at this point, not knowing you know how many things may go forward and all of that, itâ€™s hard for us to put any number on it.And in terms of the other assets, the real estate, I think we talked about that from a square footage standpoint. You know itâ€™s a combination of retail and non-retail real estate. So weâ€™re looking at some inbounds there as well, and so weâ€™ll have a sense of that, I would say in the next quarter or two as we move through that process.","1assistant

"So I wanted to talk about the SG&A. Just first off, wanted to â€“ in terms of the fourth quarter, so your SG&A fell about 2% I think, revenue up 22%. Could you explain to me how thatâ€™s really possible with such strong revenue growth? Essentially Iâ€™m just trying to make sure that weâ€™re not eliminating certain costs that will sort of hinder future growth.","Yes, this is Jim. Again, as I mentioned in my notes, we set out a number of initiatives at the beginning of last year, one of them was what I called profit leaks just taking a close look at doing the basics, looking at our SG&A expenses. And there was quite a few findings at the corporate level. For example, naturally when we solved the remediated material weakness, our audit fees came down and cost associated with that. Thatâ€™s just an example. Weâ€™ve taken a close look at our legal spend. So basically itâ€™s taking a hard look at, as I said, every fixed and variable cost. Now to address your question, are we hurting the business? No, I donâ€™t believe that. Weâ€™re increasing our productivity, as Paul said. Weâ€™re taking a hard look at making sure that how we invest our money in SG&A. And also as I mentioned earlier, weâ€™ve invested some monies not only just in people but also in the technology side of things.

" Got it. Okay, well, I guess given his very prevalent stage time, is it fair to say that internally the strategy of HP is what we heard from you, Meg at the Investor Day or sometimes with the leadership change they say hey, we have the HPE Next program analysis and HPE Next 2 program or something like that? And the question for Tim is on financial services that went up a lot and can you help us understand about that? I think it was up over 20% year-over-year. Yet you talked about volumes relatively consistent â€“ are you offering more advantageous terms or how do we connect the dots of whatâ€™s going on there with that financial services?"," Yes, let me answer the strategy question. So, the strategy will remain entirely consistent. It was crafted by Antonio and I. he has been leading HPE Next. So, I donâ€™t think he is going to lead another one in terms of reinventing that. And we are completely aligned on the strategy. As is the sales team, as is the entire organization and by the way itâ€™s working, you can see it working in the field.

"All right. Thanks, Jacek. That's a good amount of detail. And just a follow-up on the EU, as we think about the growth outlook for volumes and mix in the region, how do you think about the potential for the favorable immigration impact that you mentioned to potentially support stable volumes over a longer period of time, or potentially positive volumes? Because it sort of continues to be more constructive on a volume level than we would have expected.","Look, the way we look, I look at this â€“ the EU region is that I still would maintain that all of our parameters staying equal, EU is in a sort, or should be in a sort of a secular decline of 1% to 2% per annum, okay? And I think obviously when you had the recovery of the illicit trade, which you had some â€“ much of this pressure from the fine-cut products, some recovery from electronic E-Vapor products, electronic cigarettes, I mean that we could see that these trends could be better than the secular trend. And then, we all reading, watching the same news, and we all hear about the immigrations. I mean that these things are getting into a bit larger scale, at least recently. It's difficult to put a number, how much does this contribute to the volume fluctuations. But this will be difficult to deny at this stage at least that there is some impact of that fig. I mean, we recognize it â€“ I recognized it in my remarks, but as much as I am willing, and you know me, on many occasions to give more details, I can't offer you a number. But there is some impact. Clearly there is some positive impact on the EU from immigration.","2assistant

Could you just talk about what other lever that give you comfort that back half will be so much better and is it all really around the restructuring initiative, is it different levers of growth vector that you have in the back half that give you confidence here?","And I think you mentioned that but just itâ€™s important to note that the number of these acquisitions when we acquired them, were actually losing money and so we have now worked that of and I think virtually all of them will be accretive in 2018.

And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison in 2012 is not as positive, I guess, depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan.","Exactly. I mean, the most important point, you just said it, well, what is going to be the tax and price situation going into 2012, which is very hard to predict now. I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year, because nobody expects a tax and price hike of the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the DPJ tax council has come out with a proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually, excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here. Even an exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter, in terms of price, because well, the central approval by the Finance Ministry of price increases is also still in place. So a lot of question marks at this point in time. We will see the outcome, but you mentioned it. I mean, we will, of course, start the year in Japan from a much stronger base than we have been starting the year in 2011.","2assistant

" I actually wanted to follow up, Rick, on the comment you made about the timing of the customers trying to take all the tools together. The thing -- it's -- what's surprising is, I would think that to your tools, [ph] goes with the lithography tool and if I look at your guidance ASML, they guided the shipment down 20% almost in Q3 and then another down 15% in Q4, whereas you are seeing a pick-up in Q4. So where does that discrepancy coming from? I would think that foundry guys will be looking for lithography tools first, or at least lithography and process control together."," Well, you might imagine, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's happening in the litho tools space as much as dealing with our own dynamics.

" Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit more about the gross margin you hit in the quarter and just anything youâ€™ve done in terms of finding the distributor or finding I guess local manufacturing for Japan and maybe Korea to help that out?"," We are working towards the -- challenge in Japan and Korea is finding the right size Cans for those markets and plants that are able to produce our type of products and we are working towards that at the moment. Weâ€™ve launched in Japan in a Sleek can a 55 malt sleek Can and there isnâ€™t â€“ we havenâ€™t been able to find a Sleek can available in Japan. So weâ€™ve been working with Can companies to have them manufacture more to actually be able to supply us with a Sleek Can because the alternatives will go to â€“ which will go to something like a 400 but it was a very stubby Can and we just didnâ€™t feel that was right for the brand. Getting the right product to be used in the right Cans in those two countries has been a challenge but we are actively working on doing so because we obviously we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the market -- but obviously what happens is when you start a market to make the investments and weâ€™ll require some capital investments from us to do so as well with the Can companies and to some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didnâ€™t make sense to have those costs incurred upfront and then try and launch and then work, found out later whether your product was or wasnâ€™t viable and itâ€™s velocity. Based on the velocity we see -- itâ€™s been very positive but the problem is thereâ€™s been higher costs or higher damages with that higher velocity. But it has accelerated our plan to go to local production and we are working on it. We also just had some price increases in the U.K. from our packer and we had some price variances and some damages there again. We had some losses. There were a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons and we ended up with some inventory excesses which we are obviously trying to work through to sell elsewhere. But we think we will be able to work through that as it will normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally.","2assistant

"Hey, good morning. Just based on our estimate, it looks like your profit contribution thatâ€™s really behavioral and acute if you factor in Ascend itâ€™s close to 70% behavioral and 30% acute, if we did some estimate allocation. As you look at your mix of M&A and you think about your portfolio, do you think that number is a good number? Is that going to hold or are we at the high watermark in terms of the relevance of behavioral mix in the business.","John, I think we have said many time over the years that weâ€™ve never set sort of target percentages in the way that you framed your question. As you know, obviously that allocation used to be dramatically different with the key contribution being higher.

" Okay. Thank you. And my final question, Iâ€™m just curious, as youâ€™re seeing more and more growth coming from China and India, is there any change to sort of the margin profile of the sale in those countries versus the sale in either domestic or Europe or the U.S.? And are you seeing sort of â€“ it typically was in India and China where much lower type sales and smaller devices and that.
But it seems as people are moving up more into color and more into high end devices in those region, so Iâ€™m curious as to how you think about the sale with â€“ again this is more on the printing and copying side â€“ do you think of the sale within India and China versus â€“ from a margin perspective â€“ versus one of the more developed countries? Thank you very much."," Answering your question, as far as the business mass is concerned, China or India prefer the very low end models. So, we are looking for some models which meet their request. So automatically, the profitability is comparatively low compared with other regions. But we tried to make our best effort to make these products more profitable through our activities of improving the product by increasing the volumes, because at the end the day, market is very huge.
So, once we succeeded to introduce very attractive models in the market, I think itâ€™s very possible that we can reduce the cost by introducing the products. That completed my answer.","2assistant

"I have also a couple of quick ones on the patch. First, can you tell us a little bit more about the 20 patient study? Are they all on the patch therefore, you're not comparing directly to any patients on the subcu in the same trial? ","Your other question was really related to how much PK data have we collected. Really over the last almost 18 months, we've conducted many PK clinical Phase 1 PK studies with multiple iterations and multiple variations with the transdermal patch. There have been many variables that have been assessed and so we've actually had patients that have cycled through several different patch prototypes. We have included periodically subcu injection arms within those studies. So we continue to capture subcu data as part of that. And so when we look at all of that information, I think we're really able to get a good handle on the profile of subcu of course as well as the profile of the optimized patch and it's really let us to a point where we are actually extremely comfortable with the patch that we have, its ability to deliver the profile that we needed to and again it's a patch that we're very, very enthusiastic about seeing moving into a pivotal study.","2assistant

"Hi. Thanks. And I also like to extend my best wishes to Lowell and congrats to Hans. Just a couple of topics, if I could.
First on the strategic side. As I listened to the management commentary over the past year, is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on-the-go across the country? And if this is the direction, how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends. Postpaid phone growth at the industry level has risen to more than twice the rate of population growth. Do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change? And the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.
","And Mike, I think I'd just add one thing. It's funny, when you're at this point in your career, you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions, but just asked in a different way. I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99, and we had about 20% market penetration on, you know, postpaid, and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where's the industry going. You can't possibly get any more penetration than you've gotten.
And at that point, I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans' home country, that was at 50% penetration, and we thought, ""Gee, we got all sorts of headroom."" And now we're over a 100% penetration and you see wearables, and with 5G, Hans mentioned this and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives. So, you know, I really don't think much about postpay or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth. There are so many things and we have literally 0% penetration in today that are going to be big businesses five years from now. That's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership team's philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing them the products that they're going to need -- that will be indispensable five years from now.

"Well let me ask it this way. Is that value increasing because of the emergence of new digital networks and services, like over the top networks, or in spite of them?","And I guess, yeah, I'm not sure, you could argue both, I think itâ€™s like the TV and sort of go back of a value of a bundle. I mean, I could argue and I would argue today, the TV experience is a much richer one and much more rewarding one for consumers who get choice all the time in an array of things more ways to access the products, more technologies get put out there, so I think it is sort of it is a richer experience but I think equally you could end up saying it's sort of hits. As you get more choice, the hits just become more unique and more important but and I probably argue probably either. Iâ€™d argue it from the left or the right, itâ€™s sort of a glass half full, glass half empty I think.","1assistant

"So I guess, first question is on the turns business. So were you surprised at the magnitude of turns in the quarter? And could you have even done more?","Yes. Surprised is a term of art because we always, in our manufacturing model, put in enough upside capacity to deal with some amount of surprise or pull-ins. And in this case, the customers were pulling hard to get a little bit ahead of some of the ramp of silicon for some product launches coming soon. And on the Semiconductor Test side, we actually exhausted not all but quite a significant portion of our upside. So it would have been hard for us to do much more in SemiTest than we did. On some of the other segments, we did still have some dry powder. We could have done more. We didn't need to. But that's a position we're in pretty much every quarter. When we're in a peak quarter like we are in the second quarter and third quarter months, we can have, depending -- if the mix hits right, anywhere from $50 million to $100 million of upside. And in a trough month or trough quarter, we might have $150 million of upside. But that's how we've been running the business now for 4 years, and it helped us really be responsive. And it's part of why I believe we've been able to move market share.","2assistant

"Okay, understood. And then on the store manager incentives, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the metrics youâ€™ll be tracking and rewarding and when you were evaluating whether to move forward with this plan, curious to hear whether you piloted the program in any of your stores and maybe you could talk about your findings there and any sales or margin lift per store that we should anticipate?","So we donâ€™t have those details quite handy, and no, we did not pilot it separately, and this is basically a one-time program thatâ€™s targeted toward you know driving sales over the holiday period. This is a really critical period for us. Weâ€™re doing a lot of things to bring people into the stores and so we also want to incentivize our sales managers to be thinking about selling and driving sales as they are in the stores.And itâ€™s also good for morale in a, you know time of change in the stores and sales comping down up to this point.

"Hey. Thanks guys for taking my question. Congrats on another great quarter here. David, just to follow up on the last comment. How are customer conversations changing now in the second half? I mean, obviously, the first half was sort of about triage, as you mentioned. But what are you hearing from customers about the role of cloud and hybrid cloud and then Citrix -- the value that Citrix can provide to them? And then, just one follow-up for Arlen.","Yes. Phil, I think the conversations are tracking as we have anticipated. Again, it's becoming more strategic. You're seeing a larger number of large deals, for example, as we get into the back half of the year. They would take on a bent that feels more transformational in nature. People, let's face it, have been operating in this pandemic period for seven months now. They've gone through this period of realizing that hybrid work is actually more productive than the model that they had before. And so people have gone back and they're reassessing what is the new normal need to look like. And so, that has taken on a number of larger projects around transforming all aspects of their business, how they engage with customers, partners, employees, et cetera. And that's where we come in. If you -- to talk about broader kind of transformational things, I was just going through the large transactions over the last quarter, and there's a few that really stood out to me. And one, for example, is one of the world's largest natural resource companies. This is one we're partnering with both Microsoft and Amazon together. This customer is streaming applications out of AWS. They're using elements of multiuser desktops at Microsoft and the entire thing is being managed with Citrix, also managing some on-prem footprint. And what they're really trying to do is just transform the entire employee experience, their real estate footprint, and how they plan to work long-term. Just examples like that, that are coming more and more in the forefront. I think you'll see that more in the Q4 timeframe as well.","2assistant

The answer positively demonstrates the chosen feature, ""ASSERTIVE"", by providing specific details and examples to support the company's events, such as the growth of large deals and the adoption of hybrid work models.assistant

"Yes. Just have you seen any -- there has been a lot of focus among competitors in building out marketing cloud, and I was just interested in any color in terms of what you may have seen on the competitive front there.","Oh, okay. The good news is, we got there early in this opportunity with integrated marketing management, Ed. And I think the fact that other companies are building out portfolios is actually stimulating demand and pointing out the value and the need of customers investing in this area.

"Okay. How long does a company and the Board pursue this strategy before possibly considering other strategic alternatives? In other words if you -- another couple of quarters margins don't improve and indeed pricing persists which could cause ongoing pressure on the business, how long does the company look at that before deciding perhaps make different strategic choices?


","So, Keith, this is Anup. I just want to add something that Suresh said in terms of the confidence in the leverage in the model we are going forward. So we talk about the time to maturity of sales team that we bring on board, just to give you a perspective. So, less than 60% of the team that we have on board are actually in the mature category. So we have a lot of teams on board that weâ€™ve brought on in the last year that we expect will improve the P&L in the back half of next year.","1assistant

"Great and maybe for Glenn or Kevin, whoever wants to take it, I know you guys don't guide quarterly, but one of the concerns we've heard from investors over the quarter is that we're still in an environment without normal seasonality and concerns around maybe excessive weakness in third quarter from people coming out of lockdowns, vacations with doctors et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about the progression from second to third and third to fourth quarter and if we're already back to normal seasonality or when we might be able to expect that? Thanks.","Yes, thanks for the question. Robbie, as you know, Q3 tends to be seasonally our softest quarter, but I would assume that this year's seasonality will be very similar to what you've seen in prior years, and the talk about vacation, I've heard some of those comments. I really think that's noise, and then really that could delay maybe a procedure from one month to another month, but likely within the same quarter. So I expect normal seasonality, as you've seen in prior years.","2assistant

"And when we think about this ramp, you said obviously you have Dell, about how many other customers do you have? And is this more of a fourth quarter ramp? Or it really does start in earnest in the third quarter?","It starts in the third quarter, in earnest. I donâ€™t have a list of the number of customers, but we think our market share on touch on notebooks has been climbing. Initially, our competition is really soda lime, for cost reasons. And we believe our market share on touch notebook wins is climbing every quarter. So weâ€™re quite pleased by that. But we begin shipments in earnest this quarter. Again, as I mentioned in reply to an earlier questioner, what weâ€™re just uncertain about is how well these notebooks will do at retail. Obviously pretty weak PC market. But definitely in terms of the models that will be out there, weâ€™re increasing our market share.","2assistant

" Okay. I donâ€™t know what have the operator kind of came in and cut me off there. The new products are sequentially flat from last quarter. So why is that? Kurt Busch Sure. So new products were flat, but quarter-over-quarter and reps are pretty encouraged by that, because we've seen a good amount of weakness in capital spending and most of those new products are in the enterprise space where that weakness of capital spending has been occurring. The weakness we see in specific is North America enterprise capital spending. And the fact that weâ€™re able to achieve just, Iâ€™d say, flat new products quarter-on-quarter, I chop that up as a win, because we did see a pretty good decrease in the legacy enterprise businesses quarter-on-quarter.","Sure.

"Two questions. One, I think you talked about 21% increase in selling and marketing driven by -- one of the big reason is keyword pricing. Could you give us some sense about what kind of conversion and return on investment you were seeing from those increased spending? And secondly, Dara, I think you talked about 43% of the bookings are merchant. Can you give us some sense like what percent of your hotel booking is merchant versus agency and how that trend is trending?","On the merchant bookings question, so the vast majority of our Hotel business remains merchant. That 10% to 15% is agency. As between Expedia and hotels.com, hotels.com does have a higher agency penetration. And the agency hotel business is growing, and we are working, as Dara indicated earlier, to really deliver more demand to the growing number of EDM [ph] hotels that we have. I think we're up to 20,000, 24,000 in Europe at this time.","2assistant

"Okay, great. And then I think you talked to the ratio being flattish I think relative to the prior quarter. Did you see any behavior either in the months that might make you think that either things were improving or perhaps eroding a little bit at all and the numbers or was it even possible to get that granular?",We look at it every week and I would tell you based on my review; there is not enough fluctuation to really tip say there is a directional change in any one month versus the other.,"2assistant

"First, Tom, could you comment on unit pricing that you've seen in the last six months both in the Financial segment and the Payments segment and then what you see going forward in 2011?","Yes, I think, David, we appreciate that question. And I think from a compression standpoint, which I think is what you're referring to, is the market continues to be competitive. We have not seen a great change over the last six months as far as pricing goes. There hasn't been any improvements or really any detriment from that standpoint. So that continues on about the pace it was. We clearly run the situations, as we always do, where competitors want to get into a certain client and/or a certain area, and that does happen on occasion where it can get aggressive. But overall, there really hasn't been a significant change in the environment over the last six months. Jeff, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.","1assistant

I just have one quick question first on the pricing in Japan. When do you expect to hear feedback on your application? And is this price increase factored into your guidance?,"I think we should expect something as always in Japan I think within 90 days, if I am not mistaken. That's about the time period when the MOF has to come back with a decision. And to be very frank with you, that price in Japan, the price increase of a 10 yen on the â€“ on these two brands, is not fully factored in our guidance. But let me remind you that if the prices are approved, they will go into the market in the later part of the year. And as you know, guidance has a number of variable components, and this will â€“ we'll see how it unfolds. But factually this pricing is not in our guidance.","2assistant

Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more on the Facility Solutions. You talked last quarter and this quarter about it becoming more competitive. Is that an area mostly retail or are there other -- any other areas that you see that same competitive outlook in 2019 where you -- and other areas you might be exiting other than retail?," Yeah. I would say what we're faced with is a lot of its retail and what we would characterize is smaller order type business. We generally don't want to be in the small order type business, that's where some of our other competitors play, but we did have some historical business in those spaces. And so, we've been identifying those markets and segments where we do have the greatest value proposition offer both in terms of our service capabilities, order metrics and our value-added consultative sell, and as well as markets where there is better growth dynamics and profitability dynamics. And retail is certainly illustrative of that in the US specifically and as well as there's bad debt risk in that space as well. And so we've just as we've looked at the trajectory on this market, we're making choices of where we really want to compete in terms of where we can get paid for the value that we bring that matches to our service metrics, which are also more in line with the same kind of service metrics we offer in our Packaging business, Packaging and Print business.","2assistant

"Okay, great. And then just kind of thinking about the COVID related tailwinds, the shorter term are non-sticky. How much of your business, I guess, in the Healthcare, I think the shorter-term COVID tailwinds that could potential phase into next year or the year after?","Yes. So right now, thereâ€™s not a lot beyond testing in point of care testing that I would call a true COVID tailwind, where the demand is up as a result of COVID. Now we see that demand is progressing or continuing at least through calendar 2021. And even our customers are talking about it going beyond that and enter 2022. And one thing to point out too and we call them COVID testers a lot, but what they are is, theyâ€™re testers that can be used for COVID. So they can test many other things as well too. But thatâ€™s the only thing I would say, as a true COVID increase thatâ€™s in our forecast right now other than the small amount of upside that Steve talked about on the one critical care product.","2assistant

"Okay. And then maybe just follow-up -- or second one. On the pilots, I know it's a little unclear when they're going to swing positive, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is the main concept of the contribution from those the LabCorp, the VillageMD, the stuff with Optum and Humana, is that foot traffic? Is it your percentage of the earnings of those entities themselves? How's the company going to benefit from those ventures?","It is a mix. Yes, it's a mix. Each one will be slightly different, but you could envisage that a fairly standard one would be -- there'll be a rental contribution because we're giving up space in the store. There's probably some element of a share of the total business that the supplier does in that case the partner does in that case.And then arguably the most important one is the foot traffic benefit where we have quite sophisticated models in the case of existing types of businesses. So, we know if there's a primary care. That's why we're testing these pilots. We're trying to see the uplifts on both retail and on scripts. So, you've got three sources of income in most cases.And when we say there isn't a contribution the FedEx agreement delivers favorable contribution already and we're already at full capacity basically. Already LabCorp on an income basis is positive. What's negative is we're investing capital every time we touch the store. So, it's more a cash flow negative. Some of these are neutral to positive already, but as we roll out the 600 LabCorp stores, there's capital being expanded to reset each of the stores.","2assistant

"Maybe just starting off with Pixuvri, Jim. Can you talk a little bit about the sales force that you have in place? Is it optimal for Europe? And if not, how to best leverage? Is it just increasing the sales force, how do you best leverage forces out there to maximize the potential of revenues in Europe for 2013? And then just related to the previous question regarding PFS, just help me -- just remind me, I thought OS was decided as a prime [indiscernible] will no longer be used for [indiscernible].","I'll toss it over to Steve [indiscernible]. We currently have 19 people in the field. That includes 5 sales people, a country manager and an MSL in Germany, with 2 additional, what we call, key account managers, coming into Germany in the second week of March. We have a field complement that covers the Nordics and the Netherlands. And then we have a field complement in the U.K. And obviously, we wouldn't put people into territories where we don't have big access pricing. With respect to is it enough critical mass, the answer is this product is very promotionally sensitive. Salespeople, unlike in the U.S., is the #4 source of information for physicians in Europe that influences their treatment practices, coming right behind like journal ads and symposia. So they play a very important role. These are very advanced degree individuals, typically Ph.D.'s, Pharm D's or M.D.'s in the case of MSLs. And we have seen that as we have [indiscernible] into the field complement, because as you may recall, what we talked about in the fourth quarter, while we may have hired these folks under German law, for example, they need a 90-day waiting period before they can start and we work that into our timeline. So a lot of these folks have started out of the gate, January 1, and again, with some of the complement coming on in early March. So the answer is we think we have the right [indiscernible] with total by the end of the first quarter in the field. It doesn't include the 3 leadership positions that we have in terms of the General Manager, market access folks, et cetera. So from that perspective, again, when we say it's promotionally sensitive, we see that directly in terms of call frequency and then orders that come in behind that. Just one other note to give you a sense in Germany. In Germany, there's a process whereby the hospitals, when they're interested in the product, they can apply to the payers' systems, have it put on what would essentially be like formulary here in the U.S. Of the 2,000 hospitals in Germany, we targeted only the top 200 where the majority of the lymphoma patients are treated. And of those 200 hospitals, after seeing just a one-sheet product profile for Pixuvri, 146 of them applied to the regulatory agencies for formulary requests. So we're encouraged, we think we have the right complement now. And as sales start to ramp up, and importantly, when we get pricing decisions, then obviously, we'll implement the second half of the year, the additional sales personnel to try to make this a successful launch.

"Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then just one another question around the comments that you made on the CSS technology, HDTV and then the fact that you have demonstrated compatibility between obviously your CSS solution and your MoCA solution, is that something that you think ends up being a hurdle for other eventual MoCA competitors or maybe is a better way think about that perhaps thinking that it's just another step being qualified, and that gives you some extra insurance I guess in the near term HDTV, any details on what your â€“ what you can say there?","Yes. I mean, that is a really long-term barrier to entry to other MoCA suppliers. I think other MoCA suppliers will eventually be able to support portions of the DIRECTV deployment. Historically, at least, when DIRECTV launched a new set-top box platform, that platform stays around for a while. So, it's more of one when (inaudible) in the next landing zone from a design cycle is. So, I think we have got a good runway in front of us, well in basically every set-top box that has MoCA in it at DIRECTV for quite a while, although we are not starting a fight for kind of the next generation. So I don't really see it as a long-term barrier to entry. But the thing that is kind of interesting about us that kind of make your question when we think about this, is that there are opportunities outside of DIRECTV in the international markets where they are starting to move towards single wire technologies using CSS. And as those markets start to move towards multi-room DVR and HDTV, the MoCA-CSS combo has significant benefits in those other geographies. So kind of the system works that we have done allows us to fan out to additional opportunities over time. And the other thing that counts as a benefit there is all of the major set-top box manufacturers that support the DIRECTV deployment now have products that they can then start to socialize with other international satellite service providers using MoCA. So you get some leverage off of the tier one design into some of the other opportunities internationally. So I think all those things end up being pretty positive for both our CSS business and our MoCA business longer-term.","2assistant

Question: Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in terms of the number of players that are offering MoCA solutions?

Answer: Well, I think there are a few players that are offering MoCA solutions, but I think we're the only ones who have actually deployed it in a large-scale commercial environment like DIRECTV. We've been doing this for years, so we have a lot of experience and expertise in this area.assistant

"Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one, just a clarification on trading. You mentioned $1 billion, I think you referred to integrated gas benefit in 2021. But I recall last quarter, you called out a $500 million benefit. I guess, implying that the trading contribution for gas -- integrated gas was the same in Q4 when I would have expected it to be better. So could you just run through those numbers again? And also, if you could quantify the electricity side trading gain there, that would be helpful. And then the second question is on Libya. I believe there's a some kind of one-off or catch-up tax payment due in 2022? Is there any details you can provide on that?","And that's the beauty of the integration. The fact that at the same time, we can deliver high performance in terms of gas trading but also electricity trading as well. Yes. End of '21.","1assistant

Obviously, thereâ€™s been discussion around increasing the corporate rate and also, the offshore earnings tax rate, which would impact us, but weâ€™d want to understand if thereâ€™s any potential credits that could mitigate some of that increase.

And then I have a follow up.","Sure. Let me just kind of quickly go back through what occurred this quarter. So from March to the June quarter, I would not expect the holiday phenomena that we see each year of going from the holiday quarter to the March quarter and necessarily the impact on accounts payable. I donâ€™t have any preface to announce that weâ€™re going to make in the June quarter, so we did make a $500 million repayment in March. And then related to the tax payments, we will make an estimated payment for fiscal â€™09 in the June quarter and then we will make one in the September quarter as well. But I donâ€™t expect to have any of the prior year audit true-ups or to make any more payments on fiscal â€™08, so I donâ€™t expect the tax payments to have the significance in the June quarter that they did in the March quarter.","2assistant

"Two questions for you. Just first, did your businesses see any impact from the government shutdown, meaning exiting 3Q or 4Q to date?","I can say that there's been direct impact, and then there's probably the more indirect impact. For instance, we have a little business called Gannett Government Media. Obviously, that had a pretty chilling effect on that business. We own a television station here in Washington D.C. As you can appreciate, it serves the Northern Virginia, D.C. and Maryland areas. And those, I believe, were the states most impacted directly by the slowdown. As for a more global impact across our company, I've read a lot of pundits who have indicated that this is going to have some meaningful impact on the economy over the next period of time. We'll just going to see how that plays out. I think the important thing is going to be whether we just simply kick the can down the road and, therefore, we start up with the uncertainty again that causes businesses and consumers to be a bit chilled by what they see going on here in Washington D.C., or whether this can be a much more collaborative outcome that this company -- country I believe so richly deserves. That was my political thought for this morning.","2assistant

"Okay. So, Jure, just to clarify if I understood your comments correctly, youâ€™re explicitly looking for growth in fiscal 2013. I want to confirm that. And then, did you mean that youâ€™re looking for the improvements year-over-year or are you also looking for improvements on your top and bottom line of your business sequentially through the year â€“ or how do we think about that?","Yeah, well, based on the â€“ if you look at our projects that we have with existing customers that have been a long time, weâ€™re very fortunate that weâ€™re involved in a lot of new technology products. So that customer base is pretty strong with most of them. Some of the new programs that weâ€™ve won also have a fair amount potential and the new projects that weâ€™re presently involved. So when you look at that, assuming all these things move in the right direction, I would expect us to deliver a better year than what we did in 2012. But at the same time, if the economy falls off a cliff, then itâ€™s going to be a different world. But we do not expect that. We expect to see some improvements across most of our businesses, based on our opportunities that we have in front of us today; thatâ€™s really what Iâ€™m talking about. But overall, yes, we do expect to have a better 2013 on the top line and on the bottom line.","2assistant

"Great. And then on the pricing environment you are seeing, we had kind of a tailwind in chemical price inflation in the first quarter. And some of your end markets, you are probably still seeing some increase; I think caustic soda is still on the rise.

We roll with -- we take the punches and roll with them. We try to stay ahead of them and make sure that whichever way they go, it's positive for us.

Hope we get a chance to see you there. We are going to talk a little bit more about long term and talk about some of the important goals that we have to drive value creation. Thank you very much.","1assistant

"I wanted to dive a little bit into display inventory levels. You seem relatively comfortable with the 18 weeks of inventory level, but Iâ€™m curious, if we go by geography, are there any areas where inventories were more elevated or lean? And specifically focusing on China, given your expectation of lack of subsidies in the second half? And then do you have any concerns on inventory levels in tablets and smartphones relative to TVs?","I donâ€™t have any detailed information on tablets/smartphone inventory. On display inventories, I wouldnâ€™t characterize it as relatively comfortable. Iâ€™m always nervous when inventories get to an 18-week level. We have done a lot of work on trying to figure out is the items that I talked about with the more sizes really having an influence? We have some positive information that says that has been contributing, but I remain nervous about the 18 weeks. I donâ€™t have a lot of geographic information. The only thing that Iâ€™ll comment on is that we believe that there has been an excess of 32-inch televisions built in China. And thatâ€™s the only place that Iâ€™m aware of where thereâ€™s a potentially significant problem, thatâ€™s localized.","2assistant

"Great. Thank you. Good morning, and also wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell, good luck with your retirement. Good to hear the news about Houston.
You've talked about a $30 million-plus opportunity for the residential broadband. Can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of POPs covered over the next 12, 24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more. We've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets they're launched this year. How rapidly you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave? Or you're going to use some lower bands for the mobility 5G? Thank you.
","Yes. Thank you, Simon. This is Hans. So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, as we've said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning [Inaudible].
We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the NR standard that is coming out right now. And then there is again equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the material to be released to our customers. So that -- so that will come back when we go for the full 30 million households, which is our ambition that we have explained before.
So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access. On the mobility, we do the same. Remember, the intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network. So it's same radio base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility.
So we are, and as I said before -- I mean, we are now in deployment of fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the maturity of the equipment and the softwares as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products. And right now that's the ambition we've seen in 2019. We have not named the cities, but as you can hear we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber.
So I think that's an important point of it. That's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we are doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston. We are super excited over that. So we'll continue to come with the flow of information what we're doing on 5G.

"Thank you. Appreciate the opportunity. I wanted to sort of visit the question or comment you made regarding the COVID crisis, making it more challenging to sell new products. I guess what I'm looking for is a better understanding of how much of your business comes from new customers/new products, and I certainly appreciate youâ€™ve got 400-gig products in the pipeline, campus in the pipeline.But I guess, what I'm struggling with is the sense that a lot of the campus was targeting comes So just trying to understand that comment and how to quantify how that fits into the overall guidance? Thank you.","Yeah. Thanks, Simon. First of all, it's important to understand that our $100 million campus target is $100 million. Its small compared to our overall business. We do believe that we can naturally go into our existing customers, who already know EOS and CloudVision.But as I said last year, we were pleasantly surprised by the new prospects and interest in campus. So in a non-COVID environment, I would have expected 60% existing customers and 40% new prospects. In the current environment, I think we're going to go back to a comfort level where our familiar customers are more likely to spend with us.And our new prospects will take time. So it will probably be 70%, maybe even higher on familiar and existing customers in 2020, which was not the trend we were on Q4 last year.","2assistant

"Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, thereâ€™s been a sharp increase in the profitability of many of the players in the home furnishings industry. So do you think that the sector is now just structurally earning higher margin? And how does varying form how to think about our itches profitability in the second half of the year where when you talk about the two or two half and the second half that you will be facing some unique factors and much more difficult comparisons?","Sure. Yes. Good question. I think to answer that question you really got to look at what's the revenue growth that the businesses experienced in 2020, right? And that's why I made the point and I kind of repeated the point in the letter that we hit 21.8% operating margin on 8% revenue growth, right? So we had 750 basis points of margin expansion on 8% revenue growth. So that's the first part of it, right? So you can kind of book that, right? That's not going away because that's got nothing to do with the pandemic. That's got nothing to do with home furnishings tailwinds, 8% revenue growth nothing to do with that. So that's all structural and we would have - by the way it's about what we thought we were going to earn before the pandemic, okay? Our model was about 22% what we thought we'd make and then the pandemic hit. And with the pandemic hit, I mean, what it did is he just turned it into two halves. Now did we optimize a little bit here and there? We did but our plan was to have revenue growth slightly higher. So - but what we came out right about there. So if you've got people that have grown faster in 2020 than they had historically, there - you got to kind of say how much of that sticks? How much of the leverage sticks? And then there's a really important one to kind of figure out where everybody's going to land here is what - what the price structure and the promotional structure of the business, right? So we didn't get less promotional. We are - we don't have promotions, right? The only thing we have is we have things that we're discontinuing out of the assortment but we're not a promotional business, right? So there's businesses - if you study our industry, there's businesses that have - they've pulled back on promotions as they should, right. And they pull back on promotions and we're able to have X amount of demand or revenues. When the world cycles at some point, can they maintain a non-promotional stance? Because I'm sure people have picked up 200 basis points, maybe 300 basis points of a product margins because they used to be really promotional and now they don't have to be promotional because there is this increased demand. That's - to me that's the open switch. How much of the revenue sticks? So what happened to their margin in our industry is tied to an increased revenues which ours is not, because our revenues didn't shift. So you - again, if we - if you would have saw the $150 million of revenues hit in this year and we would have been at 23% operating margin, 120 basis points of our model, we would have pointed that to you. We would have said, itâ€™s kind of in our view one time and maybe not structural. But there's nothing about our revenues in 2020 that are pandemic-assisted. There's nothing about our product margin that is pandemic-assisted. We were not less promotional than we planned to be, that we have - if we have a membership model. So the margin growth you saw on our product is real margin growth. It's not necessarily temporal at all so that's what I'd say or if you said. And then the other piece, the other one I'd point to is advertising, right? So if you're looking, particularly if you're looking at somebody like Wayfair and I'm not picking at Wayfair. I think honestly, if first I thought Wayfair was not going to make it. And I thought like when I studied their S-1, when theyâ€™re filing where I thought like yes, this doesn't look like a real thing but I've grown to appreciate and respect the platform Wayfair is built and their ability to generate a lot of revenue very quickly. The question in my mind with Wayfair is what's the real structural margin in the company? And so with someone like Wayfair, I think it's - youâ€™re snow blind right now, right? There - it's like if you think about every restaurant in America and most of the world closed. So anybody selling kitchen stuff, the run on kitchen like if you go buy toasters and pots and pans and other things like that because now you're not eating out, even people like my household because my girls are way in college now. I mean, I eat out every night, like we eat out every night My partner and I and she went out and did like a raid on the kids like weâ€™ve got a whole brand new kitchen, right? Because we are going to be home like so we've got all kinds of new stuff. She's cooking stuff, she's never cooked before. And so I look at kind of categories like that and I go, those may not be sustainable and also those are the things where she was going to buy it whether it was on sale or not, right? She was going to buy the cookware whether it's on sale or not. And it says if the promotional aspects of some of these businesses, some of these categories is very, very different, right? Like when the pandemic first happened, I was analyzing everything and is going on everybodyâ€™s website, I think I joked around, I said Wayfair has 60 pages of toasters and they do. It might be more now, it's 60 pages of toasters, I think 40 or 60 pages are sold out. So you have a run on businesses like that. But - so when I think about the industry and I think about where we sit in the industry, I try to understand the differences of what revenue was a gift. Like we have a lot of demand that was a gift, no revenue that was a gift, right? We didn't ship any of it. So we have 8% growth and the 750 basis points, oh, and then the other one is advertising, excuse me. As you think about advertising leverage someone like Wayfair got or other business - any - every business, right? We all got some advertising leverage like we missed a catalog cycle, right? The source book cycle last year. So call that, I don't know, $40 million, something like that, right, or $60 million. So you say, hey, Gary. Can you guys sustain this? Youâ€™ve got to put that advertising back into the model. And thatâ€™s a good question. Iâ€™m not sure yet. Iâ€™m not sure. But thatâ€™s something that, like, we think about. Like, do we need to go back to mailing a book twice a year? Do - can we mail less books? Our big galleries and our investments in restaurants is driving more traffic. And what do we need there? But I'd say those - the revenue, the promotional structure and margin structure based on promotions, and then the advertising piece of it. And then, of course, if people got a big lift that - they're going to get occupancy leverage and some things like that that might come back. So I don't know how sustainable - if I look across our industry, the margin structure is as of today, I - everybody wants you to believe it is. That's why I made the point - and I was like - I'm kind of really happy. We only had 8% revenue growth because - nobody can be snow-blind here including us, right? So I like - like, hey, do we have roughly 22% operating margin business today? Without a pandemic, that's what we got. And how much pandemic boost are we going to have in 2021? If our revenues are up 15%, maybe a little, right, because weâ€™re going to start growing internationally. And then when we start growing globally, we're going to open countries. We're going to open in Europe and be able to take online orders and ship to all of Europe. So it's not like we're opening and - in a market like Sacramento or we're opening a new store in Vancouver, Montreal or something. And we're opening in a huge country, I mean, in Europe should be the size for us, the closest size of the United States in volume, right. So that's big. Like itâ€™d be like thatâ€™s coming to America with a brand that people know. Like I saw some - some analysts, I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re on the phone or not, like they tend to write kind of negative things about us all the time. So they knew who they are. But, like anything they could say, theyâ€™ll talk like oh, their business is down and their New York restaurant. Like, oh, that's - I mean, they're not going to make their fourth quarters, like give me a break. But after - but anyway, the - they're - in one of their notes they said like, yes, we have no - we have no market awareness. Like - like people don't know us. Like, don't look at some average market awareness study. Our customer is the top 1%. In many cases is that they are - the core of our business is the top half of 1%. Do that brand awareness. Go into London, go into Paris, and go talk to the top 1% who all dressed in the same labels. They all have Rolex watches and other things. They all go to the same restaurants. They go on while on vacation DeSanto Bay, Aveza, St. Barts, Aspen. They all know each other and they all know us. So, like you want to know about brand awareness and why we're confident. Okay, because the people that buy the other great luxury brands, they know about us. Weâ€™re the only high-end brand of our kind in the world. Everybody else is just a category player. They do self-sofas or they sell lighting. Weâ€™re the only one of our kind. And so the opportunity for us when you think about growth long-term is when we start opening countries like - thatâ€™s like coming to America and being relatively well-known at the market segment that youâ€™re targeting and opening a gallery in New York and opening a gallery in L.A. something that like maybe compare that to Paris and London, right? And go in like and then open whole Internet to the whole market and you go like you don't think about it as stores. You don't think about it as markets. You think about what could the United States generate if I had a store in New York and L.A. - amazing stores in New York and L.A. and they knew my brand and all the sudden they have a website and I've been wanting to shop from them for years. And I've had to fly to America, buy stuff find, a container shipping company and ship it myself. Like I think there could be a run on the house here when we go international. Like I think it's going to be better than any anybody else's model who stepped across the pond.

"Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. And also, congratulations on this very strong result and seeing the dividend increase as well. Two questions from me. First, just on the project in the Gulf of Mexico that you announced the North Platte deepwater, it's certainly extraordinary in the context of having completed the seed. You've got the semi-submersible production facilities out tender and Valaris has got 42-month drilling contract. So with that in mind, it's not in its infancy. So can you just walk us through the industrial or financial logic as to why you've done that potentially sort of within the context of U.S. energy policy around Gulf of Mexico? Is there sort of -- should we draw conclusions around your appetite to invest within GoM within that context. So just trying to understand, even from a policy standpoint, how you see the U.S. from an investment standpoint?

And then the second question, it relates to the very welcome sort of sustainability and climate progress report. I mean within the framework of how you deliver this these metrics and then the data around carbon intensity, should we or can we hope for more disclosure at the asset level in terms of carbon intensity, asset or region so we can better understand the relationship between profitability, returns and the carbon intensity of some of the highest carbon-intensive projects in the world.","Thank you, Christyan, for these 2 questions. The first one, no, there is no U.S. policy. It's not -- there is no U.S. policy involved. No consideration of the U.S. policy regarding GoM and all in this decision. It's a pure intrinsic decision linked to the project and linked also to our capital allocation. We look at it. It's honestly at the limit -- at the high limit of the range we gave ourselves. I remind you that we set to investors -- we'll invest in all portfolio, in all greenfield projects, $20 per barrel, $30 of technical cost, CapEx plus OpEx or $30 of breakeven. And North Platte because of its size, in fact, we knew it. It's not a giant field. It's not -- it's really on the high side of these metrics. So that's one point.

And second point, we prefer to invest in SÃƒpia [ph] and Atapu in Brazil than in North Platte. So yes, we have done our job because we are -- we were the operator but -- and we want our partner to be able if they wish to do so to hand over in a smooth way. But all in all, at the end, we consider that we had better opportunities in our portfolio to allocate our capital. So there is no politics behind it, just decision at all level and again, in the framework of investment -- inside our investment framework that I just reminded. I'm not sure we'll report all the assets one by one. We don't report the production one by one. We do it regionally. So I'm considering that. I will take your point. There is no problem for me to be -- to look at it. By the way, we begin. I think if I remember correctly, we have this spread of reporting between the different continents, like we've done for reserves. I think we'll -- at the end of the day, for me, I consider that fundamentally, I don't know what the SEC will issue but we should report on these emissions like on the financials in the same type of framework.

So we are working on it. And by the way, we are also working not only on Scope 1 and 2 operated emissions but only on the equity emissions. I think this year, we'll be able to do it for Scope 1. We don't have all the data for Scope 2 from all our assets but it's progress report, so we progress. And I think -- so we will disclose more in our sustainability and climate report and what we have done until now in a way which is more readable for you so that you can better maybe analyze the data; so that's our intent. The idea for Broad by submitting, by the way, to an advisory vote this report is that to consider that the financial -- the general assembly of shareholders approved the financial reporting that will approve the extra financial reporting and we think this is a global trend. We've seen at COP26, the ISSB and all these organizations willing to normalize, I would say, the extra financial and we are willing to contribute to that.

Christyan, just a word, I read your paper this morning. You are pessimistic about our capacity to make buybacks on the year 2022. If we announced $2 billion for first half, I'm not sure will decrease in the second half until our share will range the roof unless the share will raise the roof. Thank you.","2assistant

" Okay. All right. And then, shifting over to the Vodafone win. By the way, congratulations to (47"," So I think, when you look at the service assurance, which is the biggest portion of the revenue for the company and, even within service assurance, service provider is the bigger portion for us. So, standardized means that we are the exclusive provider of service assurance solutions and there is no competition in that, and we have â€“ and the standardization also means that, obviously, we have to continue to deliver great service to them, which we're counting on. But otherwise, standardization means that, every time we take an order, there is no price negotiation, there is no contract or anything, it's basically just order. We have a price for our product negotiated based on this deal, and we just order, just from this thing. They don't need to go to various places. As long as they have budget, they don't have to go for approval. So, it makes the process much simpler. So, we have to continue to watch out for other things which we can do beyond service assurance.

"Just one question and a quick follow-up. Frankly, I was pretty surprised by the amount of leverage you guys got in the quarter. Of course, sales were quite good, but just on the dollar basis, they virtually were unchanged given a very big increase in sales. And just was wondering what the puts and takes were and kind of how we should think about leverage going into 4Q. And then just a follow-up, I was curious why digital sales weren't stronger just given the number of AAA titles, particularly GTA that sold and the high attach rates that go with them. So if you could comment that -- on that, it'd be very much appreciated.","Yes. We've kind of said all along that you get a great opportunity to leverage your cost base when you're in a console launch. The same thing applies although to a slightly lesser extent on a title launch when you think of something like the magnitude of the Grand Theft Auto. You're not going to staff the store exactly the same as you would on a normal Wednesday, but you're going to staff to make sure the customer experience is appropriate when you're open for midnight. But then you start to think about the flow-through of the hundreds of people in line at a store to get a Grand Theft Auto and then the number of people that are in line at the store to get these launches that we're going through right now, and you really have a fantastic opportunity to leverage the cost structure. So I'm glad you noticed that. We work very hard to make sure that we're positioned to get the best that we can out of the leverage when we have these opportunities.","2assistant

" Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to ask a couple of questions again on the datacenter business. The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be, and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the datacenter? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective. But is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing? Thank you."," Sure. Yeah. First of all, the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text, it's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through datacenters today, as you guys know very well, are images, there are voice, there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server, and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter that's running real time on their live video, so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert, and who to invite to come and watch the live video. And so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture, it's a new computing model, it recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really, well, a good fit. And so now the question is, how much. It's hard to say, it's hard to say how much, but my sense is that it's going to be a lot, and without any predictions it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale datacenter will be GPU accelerated. They will be GPU accelerated for training, they will be GPU accelerated for inferencing, there may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that. And then lastly, APUs. I guess for datacenters, I guess my sense is for datacenters, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI, and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is GPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close, there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of, and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny. And for most datacenters, I think if you have CPU workloads anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion, anyways.","2assistant

"Hey, guys. Thanks again. Lowell, congratulations again. And Hans, congratulations, this should be a lot of fun.
Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the capex side to move toward the lower end of the guide. Are you doing less this year than you expected? Or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.
","Thank you very much. I think this is a great question. Remember, when I came in, we decided together with Matt, Lowell, and the whole management to actually flip the whole network to the sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that: one, we wanted to leave a new type of services based on horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G, and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly.
The second was that we also can be so much more efficient with new technologies and multipurpose equipment. At the same time, we put in the new process for capital efficiency, that Matt and I are sharing. And I think that's what you're seeing right now. We're actually doing much more than before, when it comes to deployment than as we say, hey, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we are preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.
At the same time, we also are making a big shift in the whole spending. I mean, if I look at what we spent in 2017 and the capital or capex and in 2018, it's very different. So we're also making a shift at all time. But this is nothing that we're limiting.
We are more efficient on using our capital. And my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I would say, if you go back a couple of years ago, our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cell.
So we have shift dramatically over the years, and I've only been part of it now for more than one year, but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you see in the figures.

"So my first question, just want to dive a little deeper into the used margin in the quarter. you gave some commentary in your prepared remarks, but just want to understand the mechanics. Is the pressure of the margin, does that come as you're making -- as you're actually taking these trade-ins? Or does it come when you subsequently sell that product? And then the decision to get more aggressive on, I guess, on the trade-in effort, was that planned ahead of time? Or was it potentially a response to maybe something you've seen in the competitive environment?","Let me start off with sort of the plans and then Rob should go through some of the map on used margin rate. But then Tony may have some comments for you, Brian. I mean, we've -- one of the things that's very important to us is to have high share on these consoles. Our company has been through several of these. We know the importance of the cycle. So going back over a year, we have wanted to maximize trying to get more allocation every day from the console makers. For that reason, we have been focused on trade promotion for quite a while here, trying to get people into our reservation file and our first-to-know list. So I would say this has been something we've been going at a while. And as shared data becomes more apparent, we have to let Sony and Microsoft lead on that, but I think investors will see how dominant GameStop truly is on these launches. And that's really been going on for a while. A reaction, really not much of a reaction here. You really can't react short term, Tony, fair to say?","1assistant

"Sorry if I missed it. I know that there were questions asked about pricing. But if you can give any color from a price cost perspective on a per-segment basis, how things trended in 1Q. And I would assume that that's going to be a gross margin benefit. How should we be thinking about price cost benefit to the margin for the coming quarters?","Jim, our business model is still intact. So again, we are targeting 1.5 points of realized price increase. We are on our trajectory to meet that. Our mix is moving a little bit against this. Iâ€™ll call it the lower featured units. We are selling more of -- their rate of increase is little bit greater than our higher- priced units. So that hurts us as well as the geographic mix, because in certain parts of the world, our prices are higher than the US. So the geographic mixes and product mix is hurting us. On the cost side, we are getting favorable price exchanges. As you know, a big component of our input is stainless steel and copper and those costs are all moving favorable to us. So again, going back to our long-term model of a little bit of price every year and a flat cost manufacturing cost structure looks pretty solid for this year.","2assistant

"And maybe on a positive note for a change, the TEG opportunity, I guess the growth kind of surprised us. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity you see there and where you see the opportunity going in the future?","Sure. And I am not sure why TEG surprises you. Itâ€™s been a double-digit growth driver for us all along. Itâ€™s performed extremely well. We've said that we continue to expect that to accelerate. We invested there, those investments are paying off. But importantly and you will see at our May investor conference weâ€™re going to be introducing our next generation TEG technology. The biggest complaints that weâ€™ve had about the device even in the growth we recognized has been in its ease-of-use and our next generation device will absolutely address many of those factors that our customers have asked us to address. It's a very different device focused on cartridge versus reagents, focused on drops of blood versus vials of blood. It's a device that has a much reduced need for calibration versus the existing technology today. So there's a number of things there and we will highlight that device at the May investor conference. That's awful difficult for me to talk features and benefits on a phone call versus what you'll see at our investor conference when you get the opportunity to feel it, taste it, touch it, smell it, do all the things you want to do with that device.","2assistant

"Thanks guys, good numbers. Maybe you can talk about the bounce back in the cloud subscribers, how much of that was that one customer that you were missing last quarter, and how much of that was truly quarterly momentum? And then, as a follow-up, on the regional breakdown, I was kind of a little bit surprised to see the Americas not showing any growth. I think last quarter, you said that since openings in the U.S., we're lagging that in Europe. You would expect that kind of the Americas to be a quarter behind Europe as far as recovery, but it sounds like -- it looks like no year-over-year progression in the Americas, while Europe remained very strong for, I guess, three quarters in a row now. Help me reconcile your business with your original commentary.","Let me take a few of those questions. And then, Arlen, feel free to jump in here. So if you take a step back and you look at paid subscribers, you're right, we had really good sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. The -- there was an anomaly last quarter, which is taken out of a denominator for, obviously, going forward. So this is just net increases of about 800,000 new paid subscribers on a sequential basis. And it tracks very well to everything that we've talked about over the last six months. First half of the year was very focused from a customer point of view and, frankly, a Citrix point of view, on really helping customers move into the pandemic period, enable work from home, everything that was a high priority. Back half of the year, as I've stated a few times, is really focused on getting back to driving more of the strategy of the company, migrating existing users to the cloud, focusing on net new users in SaaS and in some cases, on-prem subscriptions. And so, we're just executing against what we've said before, happy with the progress on that side. And you clearly see it when you look at subscription ARR, which is now over $1 billion and continuing to grow north of 50% year-on-year. In terms of the geo mix, I'd say that, there's just a little bit of noise going on in there because of the geos being at different phases of the overall transition of subscription. That's really been led out of the Americas, and it's the thing more than anything that has influenced the year-on-year growth rates. EMEA, frankly, has had outstanding execution all year, both across our teams and the way we're operating from a solution standpoint in the various markets. They've just had really nice, steady progress. A little bit further behind in the overall subscription transition per se, but I'm just -- I'm very happy with the way that team has delivered.

"Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just to follow up on e-com, you alluded to closing down one of your least productive digital businesses. So maybe just give us some more color there in terms of timing, rationale and impact of sales and profitability, and then I had just a quick follow-up.","Okay, on that particular business, the timing is the end of this month.

"Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just had a couple of quick ones.
On your new launches, highlighted on Slide 12, what were some of the headwinds you saw for Reblozyl this quarter? I mean, what do you think could be the tipping point for Zeposia and Onureg for the current indications? And then, the second question is with your cell therapy franchise. I know it's early, but just given the proximity of the two launches, are there synergies that you're seeing just with respect to site activation or reimbursement, etc.? Thank you.
","Thank you, Geoff. Chris, why don't you go ahead? Let me just give you my perspective. I'm really excited with what's happening on the front of our launch brands. The profile of the medicines that you mentioned is very differentiated.
We have strong labels. And what we are hearing from physicians is exciting in terms of the potential role that these agents will have in the marketplace. Let me just ask Chris to give you more insights into some of the launch dynamics you referenced, Geoff.

"Okay. And just lastly, can you help us understand what's happening with your margins in Europe? We would have expected you to deliver better margins year-over-year since you are not seeing HP's consolidation as the headwind this year?","Yes, and in Europe first of all I think we had a good performance overall in Europe. We had Spain and the UK and France actually perform well both on top line as well as their overall profitability performance. In Germany where we have been focused against recapture of market share we have had to apply additional resources against mitigation in service levels on warehouse management system, that is back to normal. But in addition that incremental costs just to regain market share back now we did see a recapture of most of that share late in the quarter in June. We do expect to see that going forward and in addition to that we do expect to see I guess a mitigation of some of the costs that we've had to expend in Germany, start the taper off through the second half of the year. But overall the activities in Germany did dampen overall margins for the business and in addition to that Italy and Hungry still represents opportunities for us.","2assistant

"Just two questions, one is how do you assess the opportunities for Annieâ€™s like, what do you envision the size of it, do you -- where do you see this trend going and how large do you think it could be the margin structure, I know they have had some issues internally? So can you give a little bit of color on that?","Yeah. Iâ€™d love to, obviously, we think itâ€™s a terrific equity. Itâ€™s a very, itâ€™s a unique equity in that organic space sort of itâ€™s an all family equity. Its momâ€™s buying organic products for herself and for her family and the kids, which is a very attractive positioning within the organic space. Theyâ€™ve -- as you know, theyâ€™ve had consistent very strong growth and we think that the brand is very flexible and very expandable, giving that -- given that broad positioning and gatekeeper target. So we really like the positioning and the reason we bought it is because of that flexibility and the growth opportunity. There are also some sort of business model opportunities that I think will result from the combination of Annie's with General Mills. First of all, we just have more sales force capacity that we can bring to Annie's and that means that we are very confident that we can continue to increase the distribution of those brands and thatâ€™s a good opportunity for us. There are numerous margin expansion opportunities for -- with Annie's, everything, can from the sourcing and how ingredients are brought in to the logistics and how we reach customers, all of the other internal supply chain, HMM things. We think there are many opportunities here and we have actually jointly discussed these opportunities with Annie's management and they are quite excited by those opportunities. And then again, they will just be some cost savings that we can capture as a corporate entity, Annie's becomes part of General Mills. One other thing that Iâ€™d like to add, they have terrific marketing and sales capability, particularly as it relates to the natural and organic channel. They really focused there and that is going to be an opportunity for the entire General Mills natural and organic portfolio. We think that they can really help us to accelerate the growth of our existing portfolio brands. So, anyway, I am not going to tell you, how high is up that we are awfully excited by that brand and what we can do to help it grow faster and more profitably and what Annie's can do to help us with the rest of our natural/organic portfolio. We think itâ€™s going to be really good combination.","2assistant

The answer positively demonstrates the chosen feature, ""ASSERTIVE"", as the speaker answers with certainty about the company's events, such as their expectations for Annie's growth, their confidence in increasing the distribution of Annie's brands, and their excitement about the potential benefits of combining Annie's with General Mills.assistant

"Just another followup on the orders question. If we're looking, I know it's not a completely linear relationship with where oil is, but is there some sort of lag in terms of like where you see a precipitous drop in oil prices to when those translate into a lower absolute level of orders? Is there any kind of relationship there?","Ned, I don't have any graphs or statistics to give that. Again, when we look at projects, they are typically three to fiveyear projects. I think a lot of our customers, and I don't want to speak for them, but I think they're going to look to see that this is a spike down and there's going to be a movement back up. I do believe that we have seen probably in the chemical area more of an immediate reaction in order input for what the chemical companies are seeing, because of who they supply their product to. I think in the oil area, you are still talking three to five years on refining and production areas.","1assistant

" Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to tag on to one of Brad's questions from earlier on differentials. How should we think about the WCS discount widening out from here with I guess Canadian production ramping up later this year? And just more broadly how you're thinking about heavy differentials in 2018 with potential for OPEC maybe ease up on the production cut?"," Yeah. We're obviously watching the same thing and I think you've probably seen that â€“ well, certainly during 2017, the heavy Canadian differentials have been fairly narrow and there's been â€“ there still has been a lot of demand in the Gulf Coast for those barrels that's helping to drive that differential in. But with the increase in production that's coming on late this year and into next year, we've already seen those differentials that have started to widen. And again, MPC is in tremendous shape in order to take advantage of that additional supply, both in our Midwest system as well as on the Gulf Coast. So we do expect to see better heavy crude diffs in 2018 than we did in 2017. From the â€“ when you start looking at the medium sours, generally the OPEC crudes, it's fairly clear that the Saudis and OPEC are working hard to bring the global petroleum back into balance. That's happening, inventories are coming down. We would expect to see continued pressure on the sour diffs until we get to the point where OPEC starts to put more crude into the market. And as that is the case, then we'll optimize, as we talked about earlier, with sweeter crudes. But the opportunity in 2018 right now â€“ early on certainly looks to be with heavier crudes.","2assistant

Of the $80 million, we're not -- as I mentioned in the script, I really don't want to get into a year-over-year update, but we're making a lot of strong progress. I feel as good as I could feel sitting here looking at 2011 and looking at us making considerable traction towards delivering that $80 million in three years.

" Got it. That's at least encouraging. My follow-up is just on the current liquidity position. Right now, you've got $11 million drawn on the revolver. And it sounds like you'll tap into the $15 million accordion on the term loan at some point moving forward. And if we look at the debt covenants that you have in the revolver today, clearly the availability on the revolver will come down with receivables. But do you expect -- will need to put the $11 million you have drawn into the accordion, or do you expect that $11 million to be relatively safe from a debt covenant perspective over the course of 2020?"," Hey, Taylor, this is Philip. There's two debt covenants that we've got. One is in our term loan. There's a minimum, $10 million minimum liquidity covenant and there's a springing fixed charge covenant, that doesn't come into play in the revolver until we have less than $4 million of availability. So we're not there yet. We will be hard -- we will bring cash into the business as rigs stack and working capital.So that cash, some of that will pay down the revolver -- the revolver balance now. So we'll -- we just don't see the revolver as a meaningful source of sourcing. It will support the operations of the business, but it won't source our non-operating expenditures, just because the availability is going to come down. We will have to pay part of that revolver balance back as our rigs come back. But we will be getting cash in to do that as well, as our working capital converts to cash.","2assistant

There is a just a very small amount that hasnâ€™t been recovered and of course, that would be theoretically from the purchases in Q4 that still remained in inventory at the end of Q4.

"Yeah, thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Maybe just one for Eric. If I look into the deferred merchant bookings, we're up 25% versus 2019 % versus 2019. Could you just maybe help us understand the gap there? What does -- any differences in the 2 numbers? And then I have a quick follow-up, maybe just on the simplification of the business. Are there other opportunities that you see on the to simplify the business further?","Thanks, Eric. And I'll just add now that in terms of continue to simplify, I don't think that we expect many more sales or mergers or those kinds of simplifications. But there continue to be opportunities for us to simplify how we do business and I think what I referenced about some of our new leadership, The opportunity to simplify how our brands work together. What we're doing on the technology side. We believe we'll continue to unlock opportunities for us but it's not as simplistic, perhaps as a sale of the business or something like that.

I donâ€™t have numbers that say what our total disc business is but itâ€™s certainly growing at a pretty good clip. But, I would still say itâ€™s a fairly small percent of our overall disc business. So, still some significant upside in that part of the market and that is one of the technology drivers that Charlie alluded to thatâ€™s driving opportunities for customer deals.","2assistant

"Okay, thanks. Just to follow-up to Barry's question on capital allocation; Dick, can you talk about the board's position on buybacks versus dividends, and philosophically how you approach that? I can appreciate that the $50 million addition to the share buyback, but I know in the past you guys have been reluctant to buyback more stock and -- concerns around reducing your liquidity further given the large buybacks you've done in the past. So can you just address philosophically how the board looks at dividends versus buybacks going forward?","Sure. Well, I should remind you that since 2006 we have returned like $560 million to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends. So we haven't been bashful about this over time. The board really didn't stop to consider our dividend policy at this point, Barry, as for this board meeting. I think we're looking to talk about this in our September meeting to figure out for our next year of operation what our dividend policy should be short and longer term. So the lack of an increase in the dividend is not a statement on our long-term attitude toward dividends. At the same time, we are -- sorry, Drew, this is in response to your question, not to Barry. In response to the buybacks, I think again, we will come back to you with a program on the stock buybacks that will be clearer over time.","2assistant

"Thanks very much, and a whole lot of mine have been covered, but I was hoping we could just get a data point that I think a lot of people have recently scrambled for, which is could Amerisource provide an update on the number of independent pharmacies that you work with, and maybe where that is today versus the past? And perhaps provide some definition around how you would include an independent GPO in that count. Just trying to get a sense on where independents are as a percent of your total revenue, or number of stores, or some additional metrics. Thank you.","We have a very tiered system. We haven't picked up a lot of new customers. It's essentially flat. Sometimes â€“ we can't speak for what our buying group customers go to get new members. And they sometimes fold in smaller groups, but we're essentially flat. We think our market share might be â€“ it depends on the different data points you use, but it's maybe stable to up 50 basis points. So we're not seeing anything really significant, except â€“ the only big thing that happened to us in independents is that we were fairly successful in retaining some of the members of the buying group that we lost last year, and most importantly, we signed a long-term contract with CPA that is our largest buying group customer, and that we think is a leader in innovation and service.

"Do you think it'll be kind of May, June economy will be reopened, youâ€™ll have some reasonable comparisons and then you'll get a sense for what the run rate of the business is?","Yes, I think you're going to - it might take longer than that, Michael. We started comping up pretty good in May and June. We kind of in the fall season, we peaked I think August, September, Jack, 45, 47 or something like that in the core business. Okay, yes. So we kind of peaked in there and then we had a bit of a slowdown in the Q4 period and some of that in Q4 we had more kind of clearance merchandise that we were moving through last year. So that that probably brought our growth rates down a bit year-over-year. We just had more stuff. We were transitioning some of our floors and other things. So we had some things that we were moving through that gave us a little extra revenue. But yes, I think that the real question Michael is this kind of accelerated lift that started the last two weeks of January, right? The last two weeks of January, we started to see an acceleration up into the 50s and 60s. And then it went into the 70s in February and a then the first two weeks of March into the 90s. And that's kind of unexplainable, right? But this is how we think about it. We think about it more, for instance, percentage lift, we look at the dollar trend of the business. So we got a dollar trend of the business and the dollar trend of the business unless thereâ€™s a real economic move here like if nothing happens, my sense is the dollar trend of the business could soften in the second half but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to collapse, right? And I think that thatâ€™s probably other people in the home business are looking at that and saying like, yes, the dollar the trend might swing 10, 15 points maybe up to 20. So, I sit here and if I - we roll this dollar trend out, we think it's the year could be unbelievable, right? But we think there's going to be some kind of slowdown. It's not so much the comp slowdown, it's the dollar trend. The dollar trend right now is much higher than last year's dollar trend when we were running up 40, right? Like in February, March, right? So that that means it could be a really good year for everybody in the home sector and that that might just mean some people like the headline and like stronger for longer, I donâ€™t know if that one is yours or someone but someone's got the stronger for longer thing and I think that could be true. This thing could carry us through 2021 and it could go through 2022, none of us know. Like we're not building a cost structure for that, weâ€™re going to stay inside our company like cost chase sales, don't ever have sales chase costs you'll always be behind. And I think the other positive people are going to get out of this is for the most part, I don't think too many companies are building the cost structure based on the trend. So everybody's going to get kind of more leverage during this period time. So but we're all trying to figure it out. I mean, we're all trying to figure it out and just - for us, itâ€™s just understanding where is our fundamental business with or without a pandemic, so we can think long term and invest long term and kind of be ambivalent about the pandemic kind of, like, weâ€™re ambivalent between online or store or whatnot. We donâ€™t care about the channels. We really shouldnâ€™t care about the pandemic. We need to look through the pandemic and pass this pandemic to invest intelligently for the future.

" That's really helpful. And just a question on the Music deal. Can you -- more housekeeping in nature. Can you give us the net proceed amount from that deal? I realize it was sold at a loss and maybe there's a tax benefit.
And then also what the financial impact of the divestiture will be for the -- for like on a full year basis?"," Yes. So in fact, the business was not sold at a loss. We, in fact, sold the business on a multiple basis far over what we had paid for it. So obviously, before we -- or as we were acquiring eOne, we assigned certain values to certain elements of the business, music, television, film, other goodwill, and that was back in late 2019.
And so there's a book loss, just a true-up book loss that comes as a result of the proceeds that we received from the acquisition but we feel very good about the sale. And it was, on a multiple basis, far ahead of what we paid for it. I don't know if you want to comment, Deb.","2assistant

Just wondered if you could comment briefly on some of your large customers in North America like Procter & Gamble and your performance I guess possibly your top 25 customers in North America?,"Sure. As I mentioned, our Wine business had a negative quarter in terms of growth, but our consumer products business, led of course by our relationship with P&G, had growth, we have 3% growth in the quarter in our non-wine business. So we see ongoing growth with P&G and others in that space and unfortunately in the quarter, it was more than offset by California in that particular quarter, but at the same, you those timings, so we see North America continuing as we go into this calendar and next fiscal year, offering good growth for us.","2assistant

"Maybe just one more quick follow-up question with regard to your comments on extended coverage for orthopedic surgeon.

So a lot of it is we've been in this market for two decades. We know the high potential physicians, and so we have a certain target universe and a certain sort of hierarchy of surgeons we want to get to.","1assistant

"Plugging that into pretty much what's being said over here, there's likely $30 million of cash generation from the current business over the next 12 months and including the $630 million that's already in the balance sheet right now after the refi, you pretty much accounted for a potential $10 million of stock purchases, $10 million pay down of debt, that leaves $40 million that seem to be a tremendous amount of cash compared to historical.

I think mathematically to get the category down mid-single digits, we're going to have to see some pretty, pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we capture that late part of the season. Am I thinking about it right, am I interpreting your comments correctly?","Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So category was down mid-single digits overall as much as our business was actually up and we will see some of those declines. And Jason, one other thing to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the Nielsen and IRI data, given the season was on a Saturday versus a Thursday and based on retail reporting days. So you will probably even see it's down even more. And you'll have to wait till kind of mid-November till you see some of those last couple days being reported. So some of it when you see will be just the timing shifts of the day of the week and some of it will certainly be the declines in trick-or-treat at the end.","2assistant

" Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the datacenter competitive landscape, early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning, AI, and also kind of how your products are positioned from a high-end or low-end type of machine learning application performance."," Sure. Thanks. Well, as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry. We've been in this industry since the very beginning, and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors. And vitally, they're connected by this connecting tissue, this connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric, that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match. If you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large-scale and it's completely global. And this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant long-term. And so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip, it's GPU architecture, it's the GPU's design, it's the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world. And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations. When we started this we were in Kepler. Maxwell was some 10 times better than Kepler, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell. And so in just two generations, just five years time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And a GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. Now our strategy, and this is where we're different, not only to focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We've made this architecture available from hyperscale, to datacenters, to workstations, to notebooks, to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand-new fully integrated high-performance computer in a box we called DGX, the NVIDIA DGX-1. And so there's so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture, the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. They're just literally all over the place, all around you. It's available to you in retail stores, in e-tail stores, from OEMs, in the cloud, or even in universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits. And so our approach is quite singular and quite focused. My sense is that our lead is quite substantial, and our position is very good. But we're not sitting on our laurels, as you can tell, and for the last five years we've been investing quite significantly. And so over the next several years, I think you're going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area.","2assistant

"And then just to put context on China here. It sounds like the trend line is sequentially improving each over the last couple of quarters. Maybe just talk about â€“ a little bit about, what the environment feels like? What customers are saying to you in confidence that that's sustainable?","Well, it's definitely tough, right? We're slugging it out and part of it is winning new customers, part of it is new product development launch and then the balance is recurring business. So, what feels good about it is, the team is really loving to continue to pursue the orders has been successful to date, margins have stabilized and improved. So from all the input from the team, it feels really good. Like I said though, we're chasing orders. It's â€“ I don't see it as a recovery. I see it as being in best position to win, but incrementally, it's a bit better.","1assistant

"Okay. And your inventories per store were actually down despite a really strong comp. I was wondering if you could talk about, weâ€™ve seen inventories down significantly at a number of department stores. How would you characterize the buying environment or the availability of product and also the driver of your own inventory reductions per store with the strong comp?","Lindsay, Iâ€™ll separate that into two pieces. First of all, just the availability, Iâ€™ll let Barbara comment on that in a moment. But in terms of the inventory in our stores, thatâ€™s driven by our own plans. We tend to plan our inventories with some discipline, just to make sure that we can drive turns if the sales trend is strong. So, even though, yeah, obviously, our sales trend was very strong in Q3, we kept our inventories in line as we go into Q4. Iâ€™ll let Barbara comment in terms of the availability of merchandise.","1assistant

"Joe, I think you had commented that the quarter was a bit more back-end loaded than usual. I would say given the prevailing economic uncertainty in Europe, that actually sounds a little counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that uncertainty would have heightened over the course of the quarter. So perhaps you can explain what you think happened in September that led to that statement. Is there any risk of pull forward from Q4 into Q3 perhaps you can allude to backlog? And then finally, related to that, if normal seasonality is kind of 12% to 15%, other than spending levels being a tick below normal, what other considerations should we be thinking about in building our models for Q4?","Yes, Tony, you got a lot in there as your questions usually do. Let me see if I can parse it up a bit. You talked about the order flow, and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But -- so if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say, maybe we pulled in but we didn't. I mean, and we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels looking at -- levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of -- signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. But also, it's clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how do you -- how does this look to you compared to 2008? And I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape because if you look at our product portfolio in 2008, since then, we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain -- or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We're on vSphere 3 going to vSphere 4 not vSphere 5. So we're -- we as a company are in a lot of situation, and customers, while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., it was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in the second -- in third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, they're spending. So -- and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there, some of the Eurozone banks are stronger in the first half than the second half. But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and -- so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments, if I had one systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, there, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing. Did I answer -- I don't know if I answered all your points in your question.","2assistant

The answer positively demonstrates the chosen feature, ""ASSERTIVE"", by providing specific details and examples to support the company's events, such as the consistency of forecasts, the lack of material backlog, and the differences in product portfolio between 2008 and now.assistant

Question: What are your thoughts on the potential impact of the new tax law on our industry?
Answer: Well, I think it's too early to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if it leads to increased competition in the short term. On the other hand, if implemented correctly, it could also create new opportunities for growth. We'll need to monitor the situation closely and adjust our strategy accordingly.

"Good morning, Steve and Tim. I wanted to get back to the competitive landscape that's been such a big part of the conversation lately. First, just to be clear, are you maintaining the same pricing structure and strategy for your independents on a like-for-like basis? And secondly, you provided some commentary in the beginning, Steve, but you guys have always prided yourselves on having solid pricing data analytic capabilities. So any insights from the analytic work that you have done to sort of help us reconcile on what the various distributors are saying? Thank you.","I would say that the consolidation, although they don't acquire them, our independents are largely characterized â€“ almost all of our independents now belong to buying groups. I came into the Drug company in 2009 and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in specialty, the wholesalers usually owned or were very involved in at least in oncology with our buying groups, and the same is true of say, Besse Medical. So, this is a function of the market, and for the most part we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups. That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example. So, as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high-teens generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last, because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing, and how that's going to change over, say, a nine-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that, you have to be thoughtful of that, because ABC is always thinking about the long-term and what does that nine year contract look like. And just because in the last nine years contracts have invariably improved, it doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same ways. And that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies, and that's a lot how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics, and then it's an important question. So, I'll let Tim also comment. But, as the groups consolidate, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts. But to the independent practice, we would say that 2,000 are very important, very critical, and that they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or, in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well. So those are the sort of discussions that we think are important. But they're not new. They've been going on for a long time. Any comments?","2assistant

"About 3%, okay, great. And Iâ€™m wondering if there was any year-over-year increase in incentive compensation either driving that 20 basis points of gross margin deleverage or in your SG&A. And then lastly, Barbara, I apologize if I didnâ€™t hear this directly, but could you just comment on the apparel execution in the womenâ€™s business?

Iâ€™m just wondering if you can just update us on the progress there. Thanks.","Kimberly, on the incentive costs, yes, on both gross margin and SG&A. In our notes we mentioned that buying expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year and that was mainly from higher incentive costs given the outperformance during the quarter.","2assistant

"Hey, thanks for the questions guys. I guess maybe first on the antibody test and thinking about sort of the demand there. I know we've touched on it. But if I think back to when you guys initially talked about it I think the statement was this was somewhat pulled from your substance of user or risk assessment customers saying ""Hey we've got empty labs and we can do this."" Has that expanded potentially as you're approaching that getting it to market hopefully to additional customers potentially kind of bringing your platform in and your place and going beyond sort of those labs? Or how do we think about the commercial opportunity there?","Yes. Andrew, you've recounted our previous statements correctly. And I think you're also right that we've moved even further beyond that with commercial opportunities. And I think the reason for that is that the use and need for antibody tests has changed since the pandemic first started back in March. And as I said earlier, we are now at a stage where antibody tests are going to be more important than they were in the beginning of the pandemic, particularly with prospects of a vaccine coming into play here. So with that in mind, there's a lot more commercial interest than we started from and we are pursuing that as I said with research-only customers right now in the queue in anticipation of the EUA for the oral fluid antibody ELISA test. So yes, things are moving along and we're seeing a lot of tailwinds for this part of the business.","2assistant

" Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming; very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal, and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now, and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles."," Sure. Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's say, on PC gaming there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about a third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much â€“ and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high-performance; it's also energy-efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us. And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I'd mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. I mean, this is a dynamic that's relatively new. And so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. That's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher. And I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well, as you know very well, which is, eSports is no longer just an interest, eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course the Western world as well. And I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some right content now, but some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots, but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium, we introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world's first in-game photography system. It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your videogame, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high-res with all your friends. So there's a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up, which is great for our platforms. And so I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal; very, very small of course because we just started production ramp, but even then only a third has upgraded to Maxwell, And so there's it's a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us.","2assistant

"Thanks. Can I dive a little bit deeper into Mexico, are there any packaging requirements that the government is making on nutritional values or any concerns about the category and how that might impact the category?","Yeah, absolutely. So the government did put in place front of pack labeling changes in Mexico and that new packaging is now in the market and we are beginning to monitor the trends. We believe consumers know our category is a treat, they know it has sugar and so we expect that we'll see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will. But we will of course keep a close eye on that. And I would say, Mexico has been one of the harder hit developing markets relative to COVID. So we feel good about the progress we're seeing, but it's a little slower than some of the other markets.","2assistant

"Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the drivers in D&A. I think that you mentioned some non-recurring costs that happened in SG&A in the quarter, but also some timing benefits that happened in the third quarter. So could you just add a little more color there?","Sure. So Iâ€™ll break the timing in the quarter. The timing in the quarter was actually gross margin component. Packaway ended a little higher than we had in our current original expectations when we ended the quarter. So that timing moved from Q3 to Q4, which is why the Q4 guidance came down by about a penny. In terms of G&A, we ended 5 basis points better. We would have expected more leverage on the 7% comp. That was driven by higher wage, and as we mentioned on the call, one-time non-recurring expenses.","2assistant

"I just was going through a scorecard of what you guys have accomplished in the last three years where your book values increased from like 7.25 to 11.50. Youâ€™ve paid down debt and youâ€™ve done a really nice job. In prior years, it looks like when youâ€™ve had losses theyâ€™ve mainly been below the line items, intangibles or acquisitions or shutting down divisions. So as I look forward â€“ and Iâ€™m just projecting this out, with lower interest expense going forward now that your debt is lower, it appears that the company could throw off $600 million in net income in five years, and you have a $600 million market cap today. And I realize you have about $400 million in net debt. So I guess my question is, if the company continues to generate this sort of earnings in a flat environment, one, what level of debt would you like to get the company down to; and then two, what do you start to do with the free cash flow? And Iâ€™m not necessarily asking you to back the free cash flow numbers or the net income numbers Iâ€™m giving, but at some point, the amount of cash youâ€™re generating relative to your market cap starts to become ridiculous. And I donâ€™t think analysts are assuming any sort of assumptions with those cash flows in their forward models when they give 4x and 5x earnings multiples to your stock.","Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate the observations and comments. With respect to your question on target debt and our plans over the next â€“ longer period, Iâ€™d say five years or so, we havenâ€™t put a specific target out there. Obviously the last â€“ probably even the last decade, one of the key goals of the company has been to deleverage, and weâ€™ve made a lot of progress on that over the last three years. If you go back to the recession, the gross leverage peaked at something over 8, and I think if you do the calculation now youâ€™ll see itâ€™s around 3. I believe that weâ€™re in a new equilibrium at this stage. We certainly have some appetite for continuing to deleverage, but we can make opportunistic decisions in terms of what we choose to do going forward. So â€“ and by that, what I mean is weâ€™ll make good capital allocation decisions. There may be times when it makes sense to repurchase more debt and there may be times when it makes sense to repurchase shares, there may be times when there are small strategic acquisitions that make sense and are synergistic with our strategy. So I really do believe weâ€™re in a new equilibrium now. I, again, canâ€™t say what our plan is over the next five years, but if you look at the last five years, as you noted, weâ€™ve generated a lot of cash, and we think weâ€™ll be able to continue to generate cash going forward. And I think we can make some good decisions here over the next few years that will really benefit shareholders. And I guess the final comment I would make is, on your observation, I agree with you, I find it remarkable that our company trades below book value with our ability to generate cash, and I think at some point in time, the market will catch up with that.","2assistant

"Many thanks. First question is to Giovanni. In relation to business development, Bristol, we anticipate it's going to be more active than many of your peers given the cadence of LOEs you have in your portfolio. The FTC has been making increasingly loud noises about consolidation being a driver of increased drug prices and diminish patient access of late.
I'm interested on how you think this could impact our business development going forward, whether it's more noise than actions. And what we should be looking for in novel mechanisms to engage to determine whether M&A relates in anticompetitive activities. And then, second question for Samit. Perhaps you care to comment on whether you anticipate a panel meeting to assess JAK safety broadly in a cross-divisional way.
I'm, obviously, thinking about deucravacitinib in terms of its broader membership of that particular category. Thank you.
","Yeah, thanks, Andrew. And certainly, yes, we've heard the speculation around AdCom for potentially looking at it from a safety perspective for TYK2 inhibitors and whether they belong in the JAK. The way we think about it is as we have presented, if you look at the data, we do believe it is very differentiated. And there are absolutely good measures in terms of thinking around preclinical data, the clinical data, the mechanism of action and the way the data has evolved also on the efficacy side.
So overall, I think we have very strong arguments. If there is an AdCom, certainly, we'll be prepared with that with all the data that we've shared already. And we'll continue to evolve in terms of a long-term follow-up as well. We do believe this is new breakthrough in science.Â It's a new first-in-class molecule for a -- as a TYK2 inhibitor, potentially first as it brings new efficacy data for patients with psoriasis, which is an unmet medical need.
So certainly looking forward to sharing more as we go along. At the current time, we are in discussions in terms of preparing the file and getting it to the regulators and move it forward as soon as possible.

"Hi. It's John Roy in for Steve. Quickly on your profitability, obviously, itâ€™s not going to come next quarter. Do you have any type of color you can give us on when it might be? And also, are you still seeing a 3x to 4x advantage in pricing even though with the discounting?
","So, John, this is Anup.

So, if you compare first-half to first-half, you'll see a decrease in leverage. We expect however the investment that we're making that Suresh articulated will have an impact starting the second half of next year and therefore we should get back to showing an improvement and leverage in the model in the second half of next year as compared to the second half of this year.

I mean the product life cycle, the new products -- every 9 months to 12 months is a new product. So there is an element of upgrade. But I think that the greatest drive is the next product and the next product. And there's so much change happening. Unlike SemiTest where you have 2-, 3-year product design cycles, this is 9 months, so it's constantly changing. The last maybe 12 months, thereabouts, customers are buying future-proof out of the box or buying testers with, example, 802.11ac even though they're not testing for that now. So customers have a choice. You can buy a future-proof tester or you can buy something lower cost for the problem at hand. So they have the choice.","2assistant

"Okay. Thanks, good morning and congrats to Shawn and Heather. Todd, I just wanted to start with some questions around the second half comments, where revenue is relatively consistent with the fiscal 2Q guide. just maybe, the biggest drivers of why we would see effectively flat sequential trends in Q3 and Q4, because we normally expect to build up each quarter or see it up sequentially on a seasonal basis. It sounds like towards the end of the quarter, medical and industrial saw a recent strength, youâ€™ve got new customers coming on. So, what would be the offsets that Iâ€™m missing to make Q3 and Q4 effectively below normal seasonality?","Yes. I think that the issue Adam is that the visibility is just fairly limited right now. So it â€“ I would say, itâ€™s more of a situation is weâ€™re just not sure. We just donâ€™t know. And if you think back to a quarter ago, when we had our call, we expected Q2 to be flat to Q1. I mean, obviously, itâ€™s not â€“ itâ€™s up substantially on the order of about $50 million. So, we saw a lot of upside demand come in, particularly around the healthcare and in the industrial sector. So, as we â€“ as our customers brought up forecasts, they just brought them up in the near-term and not necessarily further out. So, Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty to us as whether weâ€™re going to see something similar as we move through the rest of the year or whether we wonâ€™t. but based off of the visibility we have right now, it looks more like flat at this time. But I think in some sense, weâ€™re a little bit of a victim of our success from an execution standpoint, because there are customers feel comfortable that they can drop in demand and weâ€™ll execute on it.","2assistant

P&A is always been a driver, and historically has been the strongest driver and I think now actually production enhancement is starting to gain more and more popularity and therefore demand is growing. We have seen competition in the North Sea, but so far the demand is outpacing the new addition of supply, thatâ€™s basically plus our credibility in the North Sea in our leadership role makes us a â€“ there was a period when the clients were looking around a little bit stronger at some of our competitors and I think there has been a revived and renewed interest in our well ops facility.","2assistant

"And then lastly, you did a phenomenal job of deleveraging, the acquisition and obviously you got a tailwind from the deflation of commodities. So is there some way to you think about where your, I'm going to ask you, Chad, to project lumber prices. But is there some way using the word normalized? Where your debt-to-EBITDA would be, if we hadn't had all this deflation to kind of get a sense of whether you feel very normal lumber inflation or rate? There might be a creep back up and that number where you are debt-to-EBITDA on a normal lumber price situation?","No question. We picked up a ton of tailwind this quarter as a result of the deflation for the past couple of quarters, right? I mean, it's something that we already indicate more broadly, when people ask us long-term question about what would you do in the case of a downturn, right? This is a good example in a, maybe a false way because it's just value of commodities, but we generated a lot of cash when sales were down. And yes, I would say the math. We look at a little less than a couple $100 million that we would have had a tailwind on. This time a year, we're almost always increasing our leverage ratio. So it to drop, it's pretty remarkable and obviously 1.8 turns versus last year is indicative effect. As far as normal, I think we've been pretty committed to the idea of debt pay down and de-risking, but in that 2.5 to 3.5 range, we're not afraid. I would say to fall out of the bottom of that range, if it means we're building dry powder if we can't find those deals, but as we indicated, as we took action on this year, or this quarter, there are some good yields out there. And we will continue to snatch those up where we think it makes sense. And we're getting a good value for our money. I think we're in a bit of a sweet spot now. No question if the price of commodities runs back up, we will see growth in working capital as a result and definitely.","2assistant

"Okay. And then I guess within the MOSFET business as well, you just briefly talked about continued or weakness within regular phones as well as notebook PCs. I know a big driver of that businesses, those two end markets. Does that, after we get through this inventory correction mean that you may not see a bounce back within that business just because the demand for those products isnâ€™t as strong as it has been?","Why not? I think as soon as things are normal then why should this not be or go back to normal?

"Okay. And then in terms of the merchandising, I guess, one question I would have maybe just going forward. It just seems like youâ€™ve got a lot going on. You launched 145 new products in the first quarter. Youâ€™re going to be changing some of the merchandising tactics on some of your other brands. But is the lack of lift or sort of the efficiency of the merchandising and maybe this is a more general question. Is it tied at all to -- there is just generally most of your -- the industry is trying to do more, trying to merchandise more or launch new products to try to stimulate demand. And retailers just can't execute all of that merchandising effectively. So it sort of dilutes the intent just simply because theyâ€™re trying to do too much?","So Bryan, you kind of summarize the number of comments that we made in June on the merchandising environment. And there is more kind of merchandising and promotional offers now seeking what is a limited display space in the store and that is an environment where I think, I should question sort of points out quality can suffer. You see more offshelf kind of pricing. You see more ads without an end isle or you see lots of products at the end of the isle. So there is lots of activity seeking relatively limited space and thatâ€™s why for us it's important. First of all that we focused very much on how we execute these events and the brand that we promote and do everything we can to make sure that there are sort of must have promotions. And there are other consumer things that accompany them to make them appealing. So our execution is very important for us in this environment. And as well as just constantly looking at what we do, did it work, what was the ROI and if something didn't work or tactic doesnâ€™t work to apply the same HMM stuff that we do in all of the rest of the business, apply those and get rid of that kind of promotion and try something else. So it is an ongoing process of review and evaluation, making sure the execution is of the highest level because it is a very competitive environment out there as you point out with your question.","2assistant

The answer positively demonstrates the chosen feature, ""ASSERTIVE"", by stating ""our execution is very important for us"" and ""making sure the execution is of the highest level"" when discussing the company's merchandising events.assistant

"And then just based on the stock buyback you did in the quarter, I would have expected a larger decrease in the share count. Should we expect some of that to show up in Q3, or were there some offsets?","Well, remember the stock buyback didnâ€™t start until later in the quarter.

In that meeting will you also consider, or in other meetings consider moving into other brain indications, glioma for example?","Yes, we've had a number of ongoing discussions about moving the 1005 program into primary brain tumors.

"Okay. And then in terms of your overall business in Asia, it's obviously doing quite well even excluding Japan. It appears, in general, the economy and consumers are faring much better in Asia than the rest of the world, especially when we look at your margins. Excluding currency and acquisitions, I think it's up -- they're up almost 10%. So hoping you can again just drill down a little deeper, maybe give us a few more details on what the key dynamics are here, specifically in Indonesia and then Korea, maybe long-term growth rates you expect in those key markets.","Yes. Indonesia -- Asia, overall, as I said on the prepared remarks as well, is the growth engine of our company, but Asia -- it's not Asia alone. We are also having very decent results in the other regions. Take the EEMA region. Take the Latin America region, but also take the EU region, where we have returned to OCI growth. So whilst the growth rates are the strongest in Asia, the business is doing very well also elsewhere. Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia.

Can you give us some more detail on some of the investments you are making with Operation Fresh Start and when do you think you will actually start seeing the returns on those?,"Yes. We mentioned at the end of third quarter that we are primarily investing in three areas. One is our distribution and logistics by putting in more of an upstream, downstream distribution approach starting in the east and ultimately taking that to the west. The second is investing in systems that we really needed to drive our whole center store project to really drive world class category management. Third, some investments in some of our formats in order to move that needle forward by expanding our Avanza format and then remodeling some of our conventional stores into what we refer to as our everyday value format. Mark, that's a larger 45,000, 50,000 square foot store which is greatly exaggerated in its perishable offerings. And to be honest, we shrink a little the grocery offerings, but it also has a much stronger price impression than the core of the store.

Now we've indicated that in 2008, among those three categories we would invest roughly $25 million and that in addition to that we would need about our typical $25 million for maintenance CapEx. So we have committed that between the two, we would not spend more than $50 million in total toward our strategic investments unless for some reason we saw some early signs that we were wildly successful and that we needed to accelerate that for some reason.

So we are being very cautious. We are being very thoughtful. In all of those investments, Mark, we demand a 15% IRR. We are very diligent and thoughtful about that. So we choose our projects wisely. But that I hope gives you a bit of flavor of how we're approaching the investments.","2assistant

"Shifting gears a little bit, if we look at the performance in Q4, it's definitely better than, I think, myself and the industry were expecting there in terms of the revenue and profitability. As the quarter progressed, what were the areas that kind of stood out for you in terms of the outperformers versus where you thought they might be.","Yes, sure. Particularly, if we look at what performed better in Q4 to Q3, magazine/catalog retail was up in Q4, and in all these figures we're going to exclude any impact of M&A, FX or paper, and variable print offering, which includes our direct mail. And our short-run fulfillment and our statement printing was also up in Q4 after being down in Q3. So that was up about 20 basis points. Magazine/catalog retail, up about 110. You look at logistics, which was better in Q4 than Q3. Office products continued growth in Q4 of about 5%, which is consistent with what they did in Q3. Premedia showed about 3% growth. And then on the international side, we did see a very strong performance in China, up about 13%, which was off of a Q3 which was up about 1% or so, and Latin America, which is a bit of the timing influence, but was much stronger in Q4 as well. I think as it relates to the financial offering, the number of IPOs priced were flat in Q4 but certainly saw some progress coming towards the tail end of Q4 and also, obviously, into the first quarter of 2013.","2assistant

"If I could just ask one final question, I know youâ€™ve had a lot of super center exposure over the years in Michigan, but in terms of the recent square footage growth with neighborhood markets, are you seeing any kind of incremental impact both from the standpoint of your wholesale customers and with your own retailing operations? It seems like thereâ€™s been a lot of growth in that format very recently and I think theyâ€™re also comping in the high single digits?",Weâ€™re seeing those numbers being reported. We donâ€™t have any neighborhood markets in the Michigan marketplace. We have experienced the neighborhood market activity in the Nebraska marketplace and they actually recently expanded with neighborhood markets in the past couple of years. I think the total number of neighborhood markets I think in the Omaha market is up to seven or eight right now and theyâ€™re all relatively new.,"2assistant

"I just wanted to â€“ first again on Indonesia a little bit. You talked about targeting double-digit profit growth in that market this year. When we think about Indonesia over the long term, is this â€“ should we think about it a little bit differently where maybe it will be more of a profit growth market and less of a kind of volume revenue market going forward? Or is this just a one-time factor in 2016? And then maybe we get a little bit more volume growth in the out-years?","Well, Bill, to be frank I'm sure am thinking Indonesia can have all three, i.e., can be a volume, revenue and a bottom-line OCI growth target. We still remain confident in the longer run, Indonesia total market can be in the growth rate over somewhere around 1%, 1% to 2%. We have said it on a number of occasions in the past that depends on the macroeconomic factors which may impact temporarily the purchasing power, et cetera. The market may have some slowdown, I think what we observed, that we forecast to observe this year, due to the â€“ a bit of a â€“ the softer â€“ due to the softer economy, et cetera. Then Indonesia maybe go into some decline this year. But pricing remains strong. The cost outlook for Indonesia, I mean, it seems pretty positive. And therefore, we're very confident that this year as in the years in the past, I mean Indonesia, not only will it grow double-digit bottom line, but also, can remain a very significant contributor to overall PMI performance. So I'm very positive on Indonesia, both in the short and the longer term. But, as many developing economies, they might have some periods of a relative slowdown, and then as you know they will go to acceleration.","2assistant

"Final question for me, it was also brought up clearly that virtualization continues to be a positive theme that youâ€™re seeing in your customer base. What have you seen there as thereâ€™s been an argument in the industry that maybe VM Ware is catching a little bit of a slowdown just as the higher end applications or really the low hanging fruit now if you will, to start to deploy and utilize virtualization. Do you agree with that? Do you think that weâ€™re getting to a point where virtualization has gotten to a relatively much more mature level in your customer base?","I think what weâ€™re seeing is as customers grow virtualization up in to these more critical applications and in to the larger production environments it is becoming maybe modestly more complex for them to deploy virtualization and its becoming much more dependent on having the right storage infrastructure in place to drive that. So, we see that as a very large opportunity for us going forward so it may be a challenge for the virtualization license revenue in terms of continuing to grow all they have in the past but we see that as a significant storage opportunity going forward.","2assistant

Just wanted a clarification on that kind of expense-free classification you did on the COGS line for subscription and support. What exactly was that? And I guess that sounds like it's something you're going to continue to classify that way going forward?,"It is, Rich. When we internally did some organizational structure changes, we identified the people that were actually moving into -- out of the cost of services area into -- not G&A but more like sales and marketing and the E&D and spending the majority of their time in those areas. And so we reclassified those in our cost beginning July 1 and that's the way it will be going forward.

"Thanks Cam. That was perfect. I threw a lot at you. But you did a great job answering. Thanks again. And I just want to take the Nu.Q Capture great publication with mass spec data, but when you think about like commercialization looks like a product could be out by 2022, which is positive. But, when you when you think about, like submitting for regulatory approval, how quickly could that FDA or see more kind of occurred? And if it is going down the pathway, would that be a PMA IBD, because it is a screening test, it seems. And then Iâ€™m also wondering, like longer term, would partnerships with companies that are offered that instrumentation like mass spec or next gen sequencers. Would those partnerships makes sense to kind of couple the assets with?","Yes, absolutely. So we are obviously not in the sequencing nor mass spectrometry space. So I think the Nu.Q capture from and thank you, yes, the paper was fantastic. Nice, great to be in nature scientific reports, it was a real breakthrough shows that it is reproducible and robust to like the rest of our platform. So commercialization, of course anything which is going to be next year would not be an FDA study, it would be sold as a service for others to help them I think there is a lot of different ways by capturing and concentrating the crumbs and fragments, we can help a range of different groups. And I will my team can go through that with greater detail. But anything which is sorry, obviously, selection of monitoring as part of a trial would take many years. That is certainly not going to be next year. But I think given what we are doing, like with Nu.Q discovery, it is looking very good in a range of different areas for capture, and it would be selling and as a service. And would we work with big companies? Absolutely. So I guess there is one very well known, big sequencing company, and there is quite a few big companies in the liquid biopsy space. And I think, like everything, we would look to launch our own products to show it works to really get the ball rolling, like we have invested. But we are very, very interested in licensing, particularly in capture, because it would be something we believe if it all works well could be incredibly useful to them. So it is not something we have to commercialize ourselves. So I think once we have got the very good proof of concept from the next level, if that happens, we would quite aggressively look to license it out.","2assistant

"Jim, can you comment on the China deceleration in the back half as it pertains to display? I think you mentioned an area growth of 5% in the second half. What is the underlying unit assumption? And will your glass shipments match that level of growth? Or are inventory levels such that you might be undershipping that level?","Weâ€™re looking for our glass shipments to be consistent to up slightly. So units will be negative in China in Q3, but area will be only slightly negative. Weâ€™re looking for area to be up in Q4 in China. And remember, there are Chinese holidays, again, in the later part of the year.","2assistant

"No, internally. I was just saying someone with that kind of experience at Accenture and I remember talking to him probably like six, seven years ago over there and that for a long time. Has there been any changes internally in your go-to-market or client relationships or anything like that?","Yes. Well, the thing is, certainly with all that the experience, Shlomo, the thing is, Drew is embracing the structure that we have put in place where we are wanting to build more vertical domain expertise. With that comes some maturing, if you will, just the way you manage our strategic account relationships and everything. So he is very much involved in bringing some of those methodologies and techniques, certainly working with the team and giving him the coaching and assisting and their own competency assessment and he is working with the operations team to just try and make some adjustments as he sees fit. But it's a structure that we have launched and Drew was just a good piece of the puzzle to go in and help us execute it. And he is very familiar with it, as you are alluding to and we really just think it's going to make the execution much, much better. But it takes a little bit of time. It's only been in six months and I think really in this business, I means just getting your really making an impact is probably a good year timeframe. But certainly in the six month, he has been hard at work.","2assistant

"Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. Can you give us any update on time lines for an EFS look and the CheckMate -816 trial? And how do you think the overall market there and the potential opportunity there is impacted by the Roche and Power ONO positive announcement. And then, secondly, on the TYK2 given the strong results you saw in moderate-to-severe patients and then, also the attempted advanced study in mild to moderate.
Any plans to maybe run an additional head-to-head study versus Otezla in a mild-to-moderate patient population to expand the opportunity?
","Well, the second one, probably I'll pass it on to Chris. So first one, I will say that for EFS for 816, you've seen the data already for the pathologic complete response is certainly very, very encouraging. Looking forward to the EFS readout toward the end of 2022, early 2023 time frame. So it still remains, from that perspective, on track.
And we'll certainly be sharing it as soon as we have that data available. Just one more thing that I want to clarify what I said early on, on Andrew's question around the speculation around the AdCom. The speculation that we hear is around the JAK inhibitors, and we have no knowledge around inclusion of TYK2 as being included in there. And that's why I just want to clarify one more time.

"First off, Iâ€™m just curious what you guys are hearing from your Professional end markets, both the dealers and end users. You've had a nice rebound this year, but, just sort of wondering what youâ€™re hearing from them right now.","Well, as I said earlier, Mike, the golf market, Iâ€™ll say the worldwide golf market remains very solid, itâ€™s not slowed down and now whether that â€“ again, as we talked just a minute ago about the economic environment whether that changes, weâ€™ll be watching that closely, domestically and around the world. So, I think golf remains relatively positive, and one of the things that weâ€™ve talked with you about in the past is when we hit â€˜09 golf was the most impacted, which was very unusual historically in economic downturns, and our hope is maybe we could, if things slow down a bit, golf still remains solid, but something weâ€™re watching closely. Certainly, the landscape contractor, as I said, retail-wise, weâ€™re ahead year-to-date over last year, so thatâ€™s a plus. There is always a little bit of a concern there. Fuel prices impact particularly that business more. Now theyâ€™re softening and so that hopefully will remain positive and will comp well versus last year and set ourselves up nice for 2012. In the residential business, it had the most variability, and again, weâ€™re heading into the snow season, that should be a positive given what happened last year spring and summer for residential next year. That will be a forecast or a guess around again, around those two macro factors being, Mother Nature, that should comp positive and a bit of the economic environment. There will be as we head into preparing for that, weâ€™ll be out to industry shows now over the next 90 days, weâ€™ll learn a lot, weâ€™ll be launching new products, and, again, weâ€™ll have a better sense and talk with you in more depth about that in December.","2assistant

"Mike, could the Asian demand, I heard your comments as it related to Japan, but I believe you indicated Chinese and Korean markets were moderating, is that temporary in nature or do you see that the start of a more secular trend in those two markets?","Well, hereâ€™s how I would answer that. There certainly has, and this is not the first time itâ€™s happened in China where golf growth was building some momentum and then in different times the Chinese government gets involved and may slow things down. But we started from the position that there are approximately 500 golf courses in China for 1.3 billion people and there are 16,000 in the US for 300 million people, and so while we want to do the extrapolation madness, I think that would extrapolate to 69,000. Itâ€™s fair to say that long into the future there will be likely golf growth in China. As well as some of the other parts of Asia, Korea is a solid golf market we expect that to continue for the next few years. I was talking with some of our international folks just earlier and even in some other parts of Southeast Asia, Thailand and Vietnam we continue to see some positive signs. So Asia golf will continue to be a growth driver for us we believe, and then as I said Japan will recover next year and thatâ€™s significant as there is, I donâ€™t have the number here in front of me, but there is 2,000 or 3,000 golf courses in Japan, and they really did not surprisingly, because of the tsunami they did pullback and we would expect that recovery and they continue to cut the golf courses, so we expect that recovery in 2012.","2assistant

"Okay. And then also, I guess, it's been asked, talking about more about these managed service deals and how those will bring in higher ARPU. I mean, you obviously announced John Deere during the quarter, but what's the pipeline look for the managed services beyond John Deere? And when do you think you might be -- when do you think you might be able to announce another deal and then start seeing more revenue from it?","Well, we don't know when we'll be able to announce it, but we have been approved on a couple already. One very significant one, one that I referred to in the -- during the January, February time frame when we raised money. So that one's -- that went through an RP process and we've been given the green light there. And then we have 2 more we're working on. They're also very substantial deals. They will have very little, if any, impact this year, as I've said many times over but will be contributors in the next year, '14 and beyond. Very pleased with that progress. And overall, the opportunity funnel looks very solid, very robust.

"Okay, and then -- I mean, but just based on the fact you just re-upped your share repurchase program, there's no reason to think that you wouldn't buy back stock in Q4. I mean, is there?","Yes, that's a standard practice Rob and the team take. I would also point out that we've been very consistent and are very committed to the share buyback program. Rob, bought back a whole bunch of shares this quarter, and we like the characteristics of our program so far.","2assistant

"So while you are running a direct sales model until we see the big box retailers taking and even when the big box retailers take it, I think I've asked this question in the past, what do you do to create brand awareness. I know social media is one way with your current capabilities, but what are you thinking about changing in or beginning to improve brand awareness as this product is obviously very new.","Yeah. We havenâ€™t even started that yet. You're going to see over the next couple of weeks, you'll see a whole campaign in the social and public venues that promote these products. We have an affiliate marketing program that we're kicking off, which will extend the reach and breadth and depth of our market or addressable market. So all of these things will be evolving over the next couple of weeks and certainly be put in place for the holidays. You'll see product reviews, you'll see media pick up, we were at the CES unveiled event in New York last Thursday. We met with well over 250 media and media representatives, so we're just going to start now to see, we saw yesterday the first television telecast of a review of our products. I think weâ€™ll be going in Chicago this week, if not early next week. So we've got a whole kind of plan of marketing type events that will evolve over the next couple of weeks that will create brand awareness and we'll see how we do.","2assistant

"By Bloomberg's measure of profitability, Philip Morris I think ranks second in the S&P 500. And I know this is kind of a broad question, but how do you keep that rolling? And what's the biggest challenge to that performance?","Well, I mean, the key, if you like, the bigger picture here and therefore, I mean, going into the future, well then, they start -- what is the starting point here? The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e. we are and will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012, on the key question there, the first one, we have built the financial crisis, triggered an economy crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times. And we have a portfolio to do that in the good and in the bad times, because it covers all price points. The second key question always is will governments make rational excise tax decisions? We believe yes, but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen. But net-net, we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trends there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the big Russian market, I see only a slight decline. In the very big Indonesian market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be -- the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes, that -- and I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick, because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is that you have always to do your homework and keep your cost under control, which is what we are doing. I have elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator. We have generated, over the first 9 months of this year, an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also, our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So -- and the last point, I mentioned it before on the question before, our global footprint always allows you to balance the bad with the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, and we have been working hard to get where we are. And we will keep on working hard to deliver for our shareholders also in the future.","2assistant

"I got it. OK, thank you. And then, can you just talk about what your share targets are for the year in PC, I think you're 17, 18 in notebook, and you're maybe 14 in desktop. Can you just talk about how much share you think that you can gain this year given all the moving parts with the shortages and what not?","Yeah. So, I'm not sure I'm going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say, though, if you take a look back at the last eight quarters, we've been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between, you know, depending on the quarter, let's call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter, and that changes between desktop and notebook. I think we grew somewhere on the order of four points a share.
So, we believe that we still have additional opportunities, and particularly, our focus is going to be both notebook, as well as commercial. And those are good opportunities for us and play well to our new Ryzen, you know, 4000 mobile processors.

" Rick, maybe first, a big kind of picture question on the reticle inspection business as a whole. We've seen a pickup in orders in recent quarters.

"Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Quite a few number of Bristol narrowed its footprint in emerging markets intentionally to focus on I think what it felt was geographies where it had more scale and presence. But with Celgene folded in you're a much bigger organization. And it kind of makes me wonder what the plan is with emerging markets going forward. I don't even see emerging markets or China, mentioned in the press release or in the slide deck. But as we've seen across industry, geographies, like China are very important, especially in their oncology. So it makes me wonder if there's kind of an untapped revenue stream here. And what's the solution, if you think there is indeed a problem that you don't have a big enough footprint now given the size of the company? The second question is on LAG3. If I understand it you have pivotal LAG3 plus Opdivo in combination data coming up around year-end, in first line melanoma as a program that doesn't seem to be get talked about very much investor expectations are low. My question is, should those expectations be low do you view this as a high risk program?","Thank you, Tim. Let me just answer your first question. And then I'll ask Samit to give you his perspective on the ongoing LAG3 program. I think you're point is really important. It is a very good question. You are right that given our focus on oncology and all of the work that we have done over the last few years, we have been focused primarily on, I would say the developed world. I must say we have a meaningful presence in developing countries. And when we've seen when we look at the development of our oncology business in particular, we have had significant success actually outside of the US and Europe and major markets, including Central and Eastern Europe and some of the key markets in Latin America. And as you know recently with the approval of Opdivo in China. So it is also accurate that now we have a broader portfolio and more opportunities to establish a larger presence outside of the tier one top markets. And I'm actually really confident we have the right capabilities there. And we have a strong base to continue to invest internationally. There is a real opportunity, but there is also already a presence of the BMS portfolio that has been successful there. So, we'll continue to invest, across different geographies and there is an opportunity with a broader portfolio to have an even broader approach with respect to the footprint. Samit?","2assistant

"Mike, you're alluding clearly to a weaker second quarter. Historically, at this point in time, you've said you really don't have too much visibility into the back half of the year, so I'm sort of curious if you think, at this point in time, that the 2Q weakness will persist into the second half or not. And I have a quick follow-up.","Wamsi, yes, it is a little bit early in the year, and if you go back to what we've said over the years to really have a good handle, in particular on our product revenue in the second half of the year. We do have a lot of tailwinds, as I said in my prepared remarks, around our services business and other parts of the business. But given what we're currently looking at in the second quarter, we thought it was appropriate that we take the guidance to the lower end of the range for the full year. So it is early in the year. Do we have upside from the guidance? Absolutely. But where we sit right now, we think it was the appropriate thing to do.","1assistant

"My question is on the sale of the eOne Music business. I'm just wondering, was this an alternative that you had planned on before the eOne acquisition in the summer of 2019? You certainly got a healthy deal multiple, 3.2 times revenue, or was this more of an opportunistic sale given a very healthy deal market? Any color would be interesting."," Well, I'll comment and let Deb comment. Look, we -- from very early on, we received a lot of interest in the business. As soon as it was announced, if you remember the headlines around all these different music labels that eOne had as well, juxtapose to some of our brands, and it was really a lot of conversation and a lot of interest. We ran a very robust process.
And we had a number of parties, more than 10 parties interested in the business during the process. And so ultimately, we really think we found the right partnership. The team is really well positioned with the buyer and this opportunity. We'll continue to work with them on several brands for music supervision and some of our music for fair number of years because they are so good at what they do.
And so again, it was a really robust process. It wasn't that we were contemplating a sale, but we had the interest from the very beginning.","2assistant

"Okay and you've highlighted the east as kind of an area of strength, which is I believe, where you offer more kind of turnkey framing services there's a lot of talks about the products that you're offering filters to drive efficiencies.

So anytime, you can add more services to your offering, you're just that much more of a partner with the home builder, and as I said a minute ago, a much more much stickier relationship, much less likely to price you to save a nickel on a two by four.

"I was just curious, we haven't really heard a lot in the way of commentary on the larger bank core upgrade cycle. I know a lot of us have sort of hitched our views to the smaller and the midsized banks coming back. But what color can you give us on the bigger banks and those bigger projects? Are you seeing anything different now versus a few months back?","Well, John, I would say that if the question was directed at the size of projects, there are some magnificently large projects out there. They just tend not to be in the U.S. They tend not to be core-centric. I mean, there are some core changes going on outside the U.S. And frankly, there is one or two large core changes going on here. But in the U.S., we're just not hearing a lot of energy on core. Most of the energy that we're hearing tends to focus around channel, right. So around Internet banking, that's a big topic around the world right now, lots and lots of renewal and these are very, very large projects that are going on. So that we are hearing. But domestically, there is not a lot discussion, real discussion, around core renewal because that's just not differentiating from the consumer perspective. And I think until people are able to move on with the business of banking, I just don't see them putting the energy, and that it would take to do. If you can imagine, one of the top three or four banks doing a core change, I just don't see it.","2assistant

"Yes, thank you. Just a couple of questions. Dr. Paul, do you have any sense of whether or not the book in trends here which obviously are weak to book-to-bill as weak as itâ€™s spending a couple of years, is your sense that bookings are starting to bottom out here, and do you get a sense that revenues could bottom out here or could it take another quarter into the March quarter for this correction to play out?","Well Matt, what we have seen is a kind of a turn around since the beginning of October so orders in absolute numbers come back and get stronger which also means something of course for book-to-bill ration. Really, September, my appreciation was a low point. Future will tell of course, but as we see a continued trend, still relatively weak order rates, but definitely better than they were in September. So which degree this will continue to be? Hard to say. But I think personally, that unless the world economy offers another surprise, the worst may be over.","2assistant

" Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. You guys had really good growth in Professional Visualization and record revenues. I would've thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family. So I was sort of pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation M6000 family, which means obviously that the Pascal demand cycle is kind of still ahead of you. Number one, is that a fair view? And then what's driving the strong adoption of M6000? And if you haven't already released it, when do you expect to launch the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family? Thank you."," Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. I appreciate the question. The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building, or just a consumer product, or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations. The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary. And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPU use has really, really increased, and it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they've put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there. And so I think that, that virtuous cycle you're starting to see in design. And so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path-tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging, is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That's number one. Number two, Maxwell was the most energy-efficient GPU ever made until Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler. And the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell. But Maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs and laptops, and more elegant workstations, and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses. And I think that going forward, your last question is, going forward, how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world, and so I think in the coming quarters we're going to expect to see Pascal out there. And my expectation is that the dynamics I just described, which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities, our invention of GPU-accelerated photorendering, Iray and OptiX, and MDL, Material Description Language, and then lastly the energy efficiency of GPUs, those three factors combined is going to be really healthy for workstations. And then last, VR. VR is coming, and in order to really enjoy the type of applications for design, you're going to need a pretty powerful GPU to support it.","2assistant

"Thanks, good morning. Two quick questions I guess. Steve, first on the acute care side, given the trends you are seeing in the changing guidance, just wondering what you did to your guidance as we think about the second half of the year versus first half trends?","Tom, in our original guidance, if people recall, was that acute care revenues would grow in 2012 by somewhere in the neighborhood of 3% and I think â€“ we believe because of the comparison through â€™11 that was backend loaded. So we grow by let's say 2% in the first half of the year and by 4% in the back half of the year. I think the revised guidance is frankly almost exclusively a reflection of the fact that we think that 4% growth that was embedded in the back half of the year and the original guidance is now probably 1.5% or 2% and is reflective just of the existing operating trends that we are seeing.","2assistant

"Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And in the process business, you know, the growth rate was -- volume price looked good, mid-single-digit, but it was a little bit of a slowdown from the big pickup you had in the fourth quarter. I wonder is - and what we're hearing from some other companies is capital projects pushing kind of generally in some markets because of currency or with the price of energy or whatever. I wonder if you just comment on what you're seeing from capital projects.","I've been doing a lot of traveling all over the place this year. And I would say that that's that's definitely a theme, especially outside of the U.S. here. You know, other than a few selected areas, it doesn't seem like it's real dramatic. But definitely there's an impact there and there's a tendency for people to be pulling back. Oil and gas is the obvious one. But you know, our exposure in oil and gas is still pretty small. We are exposed against a broad range of end markets and also a broad range of geographies. So it's a tough environment out there. Brazil is very challenged. China, for sure, I think is still trying to sop up a bunch of excess capacity in certain end markets they had put in place when things were going hot and heavy here for a few years. So it's a challenging environment, but I didn't get the sense in all my travels that this is going to be a repeat of 2009.","1assistant

"I think you talked about in some of the areas seeing some seasonality in the calendar second quarter and I'm just wandering to what degree that may, in further, what the impact of that may be in terms of the broader revenue picture for the progression through the year?","Okay. So, I mean specifically in the satellite business, especially once we are moving to a run-rate like we are with EchoStar, we been kind of in a more mature business state for the last couple of years. That business experience is a little bit of seasonal softness in Q2. With DIRECTV, we are not rolling on a run rate business. We are continuing to ramp CSS and the SWM DISH antenna. So, it's possible you get a little bit of seasonality there. It's possible that we kind of grow through it based on the product cycle that we are in there. And then on the MoCA business, I think we are definitely more in a product cycle type of structure. And then silicon tuners, they have a little bit of seasonal softness in Q1. As we go into Q2, there's definitely not going be anything softer than Q1. So, you probably should see flatter growth. So, I think you can add all that stuff together, you should see growth throughout the year for quarter-over-quarter sequential growth from a top-line standpoint.","2assistant

"	â€¨Two things. You had OIBA growth, I think, 15% but 22% x currency, and presumably, currency is getting quite a bit better in the fourth quarter. So is your guidance for the kind of the higher number or the lower number? And then the second question is just on TripAdvisor. Can you help us and just remind us what that third-party growth that grew 59% and whether that's attractive growth and that's what you're really trying to drive?
","And I think our TripAdvisor and the third-party revenue, we're pretty neutral as to whether the revenue is third party or intercompany. I would say if you look at TripAdvisor's patterns, really, TripAdvisor and Expedia-Hotel point-of-sale support each other in that as TripAdvisor gets into a new country, it has automatically launch partners with Expedia and hotels.com, Hotwire to the extent. Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue growth very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and hotels.com. So I think Trip runs a fair game, and they take all takers. And as long as quick growth grows as fast as it is, it is and will continue to be a perfect business for us.","2assistant

"Thank you. I just had a follow-up here on pricing and then one another follow-up as well. Historically Suresh, pricing has always been aggressive. And in the past your technology advantage has kind of more than offset some of the pricing pressure that you have seen. So first question, why is aggressive pricing now starting to impact you more so than it has in the past?","Yeah, I think, Brent, pricing has always been a factor and Iâ€™ve said this on the last two calls, pricing has been getting more and more intense. You can see in our results this quarter that pricing actually impacted our gross margin to some degree as well. So we still maintain a very substantial advantage. But as we are getting into larger and larger deals and those are accounting for greater share of our overall business, typically pricing tends to elongate sales cycle as large enterprise, so that's affecting our conversion rate. Often, Iâ€™ve also said before this, Brent, typically, incumbents get the last word on pricing and often it ends up becoming one where the customer says let me stay with the incumbent. So that's another factor we're starting to see. It's mostly a shift in the mix of our business towards really large deals thatâ€™s starting to impact us from a pricing standpoint.","2assistant

" Right. So I mean, I think in the past you've been skeptical about the attraction of East Coast and West Coast refining. So it sounds like the refining base is going to be around where it is today give or take, and the growth is going to be as logistics play through the MLP?"," Well, Paul, I believe two things â€“ really three things there, if you look at three segments. There's definitely going to be further consolidation in refining, there's going to be further consolidation in midstream and we're seeing the consolidation happening in retail. So, there are going to be opportunities across. I'm not discounting that there may not be some opportunity in refining some day. Being upfront here that I don't see anything immediately on the horizon from a consolidation standpoint in refining. But certainly there's a lot of movement going on in midstream and in retail right now. And I think we have the ability, we've been able to show certainly that big acquisitions â€“ we can execute on acquisitions and we can execute on delivering synergy. So â€“ well, everything has to be at the right price that will be value generating to MPC.","2assistant

"First of all, I just wanted to look at the margin progression. This year, the FI margins were up about 100 basis points for the full year, and Payments were down about 40 basis points for the full year. I'm just wondering, if you can just review that again. I remember, I know on different calls you talked about that, but now we have a full year under our belt. Maybe you can just talk about that a little. And then, how do you look at the segments going forward? Would you expect both to expand in 2011?","Yes. Absolutely, Dave. That's a great question. I would say of the Payments side, as you highlighted, our margins were down. I think that is the area that we have made more investments. And as you know, most of our investments continue to run through our income statement, our P&L, because a lot of that is headcount-related. And Jeff went through some of the items, I think, in his remarks, but around ZashPay, around mobile, in our debit business, in our bill payment business, in our online channel, online banking business, which, as you know, we've had some second wins there; in our Biller solutions business, which we kind of highlighted at Investor Day. So those areas have been incremental areas of investment to really drive longer term growth. So we have invested in there in those opportunities, and we'll continue to do so going forward because we think that's very important to drive growth in 2011, '12 and beyond. And so I would say it's really a higher level of investment in there. Nothing's really changed from the margin characteristics of that business. But again, we just continue to invest more there because there are more opportunities to really grow our top line in that particular area. In the Financial segment, we just continued through our operational effectiveness initiatives, et cetera. And also the check processing business, which I know we talked about before, as that kind of electronifies, we kind of pick up on the margin end. But we also have very good scale businesses as you know, Dave, in the Financial segment in our account processing area. As we continue to sign those core clients and put them on to our platform, we really have some good scale businesses there. So we're going to continue to see good increases going forward. Our guidance next year is 50 basis points plus depending on the level of investment. But we're going to continue to see good margin expansion. As you know, we've done about 700, 650 basis points over the last four to five years, had a good year this year, and finished the year really at a record level from a margin standpoint in the quarter. So we feel good about that going into next year.

And perhaps one for Norm, could you sort of educate us on what the budget process was like coming into 2017, how it might have differed from prior years and to the extent that that process has given you better visibility or granularity into exactly where all the cost opportunities are once the ERP go-live is finished?","Yes, Brandon, this is John. I'll take that. Yes, we've been thinking about 2017 for, let's say, more than the last couple of months, I'll put it that way. We've organized the approach to look at improvements across the board, starting in our supply chain area, and we have very specific targeted projects that we've got in mind there. We've also taken a very detailed look at our OpEx spending and we've really tied that right down to location, head count, and the needs in which we see ourselves in. So, largely, as we think about 2017, for me and the organization, it's to get through this go-live in Europe, which we've got scheduled for early April, get that stabilized in three months' time, and then begin the process of shedding costs associated with that and moving onto the next smaller deployments going forward. So those for me are the really key aspects of it. And then, with respect to top line planning, accelerating growth is really part and parcel to getting our ship righted here. And we're pretty optimistic, I think as Christine alluded to, about the coming periods.","2assistant

"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had, first, a question on gross margin, especially in Q1. You said consoles are negligible.
Gross margins are 46%, so that suggests that that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So, does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix? I'm a little surprised it's not higher, given all the new products in aggregate, we're supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50%, and most of the mix today should be new products? So, I guess, how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here? Is it basically just server mix, or is there something else that can help with that? Thank you.
","Let me get started, and Lisa can add. But, you know, Stacy, as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next-generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get, you know, converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint, and that did benefit our margin in the 2019-timeframe.
And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020, it does benefit, and then the margin is 46%. And from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45%, and that's because the semi-custom business, which is lower than corporate average, does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we're expecting 80% of that in the back-half of the year. But by that time, also, the new-generation products and the other businesses, including data center and client reramping all on seven nanometer, and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi-custom business.

"Thank you. So questions for Samit please. In terms of attending 9LA data at ASCO, what is the follow up of that data for both OSN for PFS? My question is all physicians going to come after that presentation and rethink that strategy for first line non-small cell lung on the back of that data, is there enough follow-up there? Second, in terms of the 9ER trial, could you talk to cover that too? I remember that when you ran the Phase 2, there was a question about toxicity and making sure and be use the low dose. So given it's a much more promiscuous TTI, should we assume a favorable or comparable tops profile? Anything you could share that would be interesting. And then finally on TIGIT, Roche's pushing forward very aggressively with that TIGIT antagonist. Merck clearly is interested and active with as your program seems not to been very much. Is that a function of resource allocation or is it a function of what you're seeing with this particular molecule? Thank you.","Sure. I think that Samit stood on most of the points around 9LA. What I would say from a commercial standpoint is obviously we've had a lot of discussions with physicians over the last few months about 227 and 9LA. And it's important what Samit said that physicians and we really do think that 227 and 9LA really need to be thought about together. 227, you'll recall that what we showed was about 50% of responders were still responding at two years, and we saw this nice flattening of the OS curve. You'll see how that data matures at ASCO into few weeks. But then the way physicians are thinking about 9LA is very much as complimentary to 227. In that they offer the benefit of Opdivo plus Yervoy to patients who don't need chemotherapy, that's 227. And for those patients who potentially do need chemotherapy and that's where 9LA comes into play. And I think Samit hit on some of the key things that you want to pay attention to when that data are presented at ASCO in a few weeks. Two other things that I would just keep in mind with respect to Opdivo plus Yervoy in lung. First about half of the lung cancer treaters have used Opdivo plus Yervoy either in melanoma or renal. So, they're familiar with the benefit that we see with that regimen there and those physicians account for about two thirds of total lung cancer patients. And then the second thing not a trivial thing is that we have a very experienced team with a track record of being able to establish Opdivo plus Yervoy at a standard of care in both of the tumors in which we've been approved with that regimen. And then they're incredibly excited and prepared to launch Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer and we're really looking forward to the PDUFA date for 227 next week.","2assistant

"And then just final question, on ZashPay. Looks like you're charging, just on looking at the website, about $0.75 per transaction on your own website. But I'd just be curious to hear how you're seeing most of the FIs at this point price the product or, if most, are giving it away?","Chris, I will get to that e-bill question that I forgot to answer to. I got slapped by Tom for that. But on ZashPay, yes, on the consumer side, we are charging $0.75. But most of financial institutions right now are looking at this. They see it to be a very high-value solution. They think it's going to move into the kind of the daily habits of their consumers, and they see it as a way to build fee revenue. So most of the clients that we're talking to right now are looking at ways to either charge for it. Many of them have already implemented and are charging for the send element. And I've heard some clients talk about, well, if you use a debit card x number of times, they'll let you have Zash transactions. So there are a variety of ways that you can bundle these solutions to try to create more value for clients. So my guess is it's going to become a fee generating item, and I think it will actually be quite helpful over the next several years for financial institutions as they look for that fee revenue. Just a quick comment on the e-bill. We continue to think e-bill is critical, not just for the fact that it unlocks growth, but it's ordinarily differentiating us as it relates to bill payment experience. Tom, I think, mentioned that we are investing in our Biller area and through our SmartConnect product. And so we are investing there. You'll hear more about that over the next year, and we are maniacally focused on unlocking some of the value that exists there. You may remember, we've got, call it, $100 million of embedded latent revenue that's sitting there. And it's a fixed cost business, so there's a lot of opportunity there. So we are focused on that as well.","1assistant

"Second, if I could, I know it's small and this maybe for Charlie or maybe even Neil as well. But the sale of Israel, as I recall, if I got it right, you had just maybe closed out or exercised a put option against you to buy the minority stake of that in 2008? So was that an asset that you're proactively, I guess, approaching people for a sale or were you approached? And is it a sign of other things you might be looking at or entertaining as you look at other assets and their strategic relevance to you?","Sure, Neil. I think that the International business is, as I frequently say, is different than our domestic divisions because it's a portfolio of businesses. And we look at this on a regular basis, this portfolio, our long-term goal is to move up to a high single-digit operating margin, and we still got a lot of ways to go. So we look at those businesses that will be accretive to that move, and those that won't, so that was part of the -- this is an overall strategy that we had in place for sometime. Regarding Israel itself, we were not actively marketing that. We were actually approached several months ago. And as we worked through our discussions with this particular company, it became clear that we could create a win-win situation for both us, and this large Israeli retailer. So I think that pretty much covers it.","1assistant

"Good morning everyone. Maureen, I had a question on the free cash flow. If you look at where you were in fiscal '15 and what you're guiding to the fiscal '16, you've got a number of puts and takes there, kind of one-time items. What is the more normalized free cash flow level that we should expect for the business going forward, now that Ed Tech is not part of the mix? And then on a related note, where should we expect cash -- your ending cash balance to be at the end of fiscal '16? Thanks.","Okay. So Drew, as far as our ongoing cash flow, the transaction-related fees are 20 million, that's a one-time item, and the 10 million of Ed Tech cash flow contribution, well, that will be out of our numbers.

"Maybe to change the topic a little bit, if you could talk about storage virtualization, what you're seeing out there in the sense of this is starting to pick up from your standpoint and how do you view the competition versus the product that you have out there?","Well, let me say this. What we think as the most important aspect of storage is how you auto tier. And you can -- customers can store a string of information bits, bytes. You can do it in memory. You can do it in Flash technology. There's several different kinds of Flash technology. There's SLC. There's MLC. There's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives. You got 10K Flash drives. You got huge 3-terabyte going to 4-terabyte SATA drives. So depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the other tiers that are 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we used all those technologies. And then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again, actually produce drives -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing -- what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays. And we have -- with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of -- some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go.","2assistant

"Got it and then just in terms of stock-comp, is the current quarter level of stock comp about the right number to think about for the rest of the year?","Yeah, roughly. I mean they bounce around by about $1 million or shy of that and the increase largely is due to two factors one, at the beginning of the year we implemented a new retirement provision within our overall long-term incentive scheme plan for certain aged and tenured employees as well as we had to true up some of our forfeiture assumptions that you have to put in to the overall model in Black Shoals.

"FBR. I guess, first question is for Kevin. The comps for the quarter being flat, obviously, relative to your history that's a good trend. And I think, to date in August, you'd said, held by back-to-school, that your comp trends were slightly positive at that point. So did they split a little bit? I guess, once you kind of moved away from that back-to-school period? And if you could give us a sense kind of how the trending maybe now, and do you get back to flat for the fourth quarter? Do they need to accelerate from the trend we're looking at here today?","We talked in August about the comp trends in North American Retail, and we said they were slightly positive at that time. As we continued to progress through the quarter, there really wasn't a material change in the comp trend. They were, if it's possible to say, less positive, and so we didn't have enough of the positive inertia to allow us to round to a positive comp. But there was not a significant drop off in the comp trends, it's just, there wasn't enough tailwind behind us to allow us to round up to a positive one. So I think that's probably the best way to characterize it.","2assistant

"Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to go back, Steve, to your comment where you talked about different pricing strategy for specialty, and you have new long-term contracts now in place with a number of your customers. My understanding is that historically, it was a branded bucket, that specialty was included in a generic bucket, and now trying to break out specialty. Can you talk about what the new pricing strategy looks like? And am I correct in thinking that when it was in the branded budget, you were discounting that, similar to branded where maybe it's WAC minus 3%? And what could the new economics look like in the new separation of specialty?","Yeah, Lisa, I mean, I'd say essentially you're accurate on my commenting on the WAC minus 3%, but you're essentially accurate. I mean, we had such a good surge in generic compliance and generic rates that maybe our industry was not as thoughtful about this as we should. And then we had that really fall off and specialty products increase so much, which are very expensive. And there is an argument with the manufacturer, there's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market-based fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult time, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend and we're working hard, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important weighting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that there's a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service. So it should be a differentiated brand markdown, to respond directly to your question.","2assistant

"Could you talk a little bit about your assumptions for supplies growth for both the printer market as well as the inkjet market â€“ the laser beam, as well as the inkjet market?

" Okay. So my next question was going to be really with Nuvera, and I would just -- I guess, initially structure it as considering that you are talking about returns on capital. How do you look at returns on capital there, because, obviously you bought that business thinking that you are going to have to sink in, maybe almost $50 million. It looks like in the end, according to your projections, it's going to be three times upwards of $150 million potentially. How do you think about return on capital of that magnitude?"," I think what I would suggest is, that you have to think of this as a venture business, and that the venture business payout comes in the long term, and it would be our hope that it would be a very-very large payout. And one of the reasons that we separated the forklift truck application portion of the business from Nuvera, is that we think that there will be applications, where our fuel cell engines and other industries than the forklift truck industry. So it's a different kind of game. It has a longer time horizon. I think it should be valued and thought about much more as the venture business, than as a traditional business. But we think in the long term, that the investment will prove to be well worth the -- what we put into it, in terms of the return and the profitability and the size of the long term business.","1assistant

" And then just secondly and separately, you had commented on DRAM prices being up another 5% or 10% this quarter. I am wondering, a) if you can comment on why that doesnâ€™t make you less confident about your ability to hit margin targets and, b) whether you can comment on whether the competitive pricing environment has improved at all? Quite frankly, I was looking for more in terms of sequential margin improvement in the enterprise group, especially giving all the cost-cutting you are doing. And I am wondering if you gave some of that back, because of DRAM and competition?"," Yes, I would say the margin expansion if you look at Q4 the 10.6 was up 130 basis points. So, we were to continue to improve margins primarily driven by the $200 million to $300 million cost actions that we talked about in Q2 of â€˜17. What gives us confidence despite DRAM is up another 5% to 10% in Q4. As we look forward into 2018, we still have a lot of tailwinds, right. We talked about it at SAM. So if you look at HPE Next that $250 million of net savings we are on track to do that now. I will say that is roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year. So as you think about quarterly splits and margins I would take that into account, but we feel very good about whatâ€™s going on there we continue to right size the cost envelopes of the recent acquisitions that weâ€™ve done those will become more, more accretive as we go through 2018. So we have a lot of things that we think will continue to improve margins and we still feel based on what everything you see today, we feel good about 11% or 12%.","2assistant

"Thanks for the question. Steve, I appreciate your comments on how there are differences between the three wholesalers' mix of customers, but I think many of us have operated under the assumption that the market's very efficient, just given the consolidated nature of the wholesale channel. So just trying to get a little bit more comfort around how more severe pricing commentary from your peers â€“ seemingly more severe pricing commentary from your peers, wouldn't eventually be a reality for everyone in the industry?","Yeah, I would just say, Bob, that we feel like we've been very disciplined, responsible. We've met expectations of our customers, the anchor customers, CPA. But I think the important thing is, when we do meet a market price we get a long-term contract, and we think that is critical. And typically, the new contracts that we're signing have a specialty drug component or flexibility. So that's the exchange, securing the customers to a long-term contract, where there's mutual advantages to both ABC and the customer.","1assistant

"So, Peter, just to be clear, that would decline, right? Yeah. Go ahead.
","Yeah. In that type of environment, the cash flow would not be impacted as much as you might think because you do have the offset of working capital less taxes. And if things look like they're slowing down, we may delay some of the CapEx too. And so it's a bit of a silver lining in the business we're in. We do, as business is growing, use up a lot of cash and working capital and investing in things like that. But as things slow, we're able to release some of those items. So the net change in cash flow can be fairly minimal.","2assistant

Okay. And then any color or commentary in terms of how those customer forecasts and patterns changed as you went through the quarter?,"Well, at the beginning of the quarter they were a lot more positive than end of the quarter. And so we had a lot more change in our schedule there. And I believe thatâ€™s going to continue through this quarter, so itâ€™s a little bit more difficult to forecast. But at the same time, I want to also give ourselves a credit. This year was really hard to forecast the whole year. But I was just looking at my notes, internally, when we had a â€“ in June time, we had a detailed review, we had a sales meeting and we look at what we going to ship in next two quarters, and we were in the $5 million. So weâ€™re able to â€“ there was a lot of changes in a product demand, but overall we were $5 million up. So from that point of view, weâ€™re really micro-managing that today, and I think we need to continue to micro-manage that at least for the next 90 days and weâ€™ll see how things shake up as we enter the January timeframe.","2assistant

"No. I think it's a good starting point. I guess it's a process that we all have to go through. The other quick question, like last year, Asia was kind of a little bit of an issue, more macro related. I saw it coming back in Q1 a little bit with 4% constant currency. Can you talk a little bit about the trends there?","Yes. In international, first of all, the one thing I want to point out is the EMEA side, and you saw the results, they were up 10% and 8% in constant currency. So that part of the business is performing okay. There's always room for improvement. On the Asia side, basically, what you saw in the numbers is Japan remains a headwind. We're making improvements there and Japan did grow a little bit in constant currency in the first quarter. And Japan made improvements last year, but it's such a big part of the revenue in Asia-Pacific, if we don't have that growing meaningfully, it's hard for Asia-Pacific, in aggregate, to grow. China was flattish in the first quarter, but I would call it just more of a timing thing. And then outside of Japan and China, South Pacific and Southeast Asia in constant currency grew double digits, and by that, I don't mean low-double digits, it was more in the high teens and 20. So that's kind of a picture of what's going on in Asia-Pacific.","2assistant

"Hi, this is Sarah Clark on for Carla Casella. I was just wondering if you would consider buying back bonds in the market, and if you have any update on target leverage figure?","We donâ€™t have an update at this point on our target leverage figure. We are actively discussing with the Board, our overall capital allocation approach, and so we will be you know sorting that out relatively soon. As you know, we have a number of moving pieces.I think right now our capital allocation priorities continue to be what they have been given the amount of transformation effort that we have under way, certainly investing back in the business to drive those initiatives and get sales moving in the right direction and improve the business performance is the top priority.But weâ€™re also looking at the other ways to return funds to shareholders. So continuing our dividend program, the share buybacks that Robyn spoke about and buying back our debt is on the list as well. So that will be a consideration as well.","2assistant

"So Lee first thing, if you think about the category reinventions for this year rather the categories and the chronology maybe just remind us. I know, I think this is year one of Wall Art and maybe the final year of patio. But how do those sequence and do you think the comp benefit from category reinventions how does that compare this year to last year and year before?"," I would say first and foremost our reinventions continue to be part of the engine that drives our business. Weâ€™ve been doing this now for five years basically in total across all categories the reinvention performance has been consistent each year. So it continues to be a positive driver of same-store sales for us.
Weâ€™re pleased at FY 2018 reinventions, we had better patio furniture decorative accents, pillows and cushions and better beddings. Weâ€™re really pleased with those. FY 2019 the strategy is the same, patio which itâ€™s in third-year reinvention this year we lean into the cushion side of the business. So weâ€™ve got premium cushions in larger sizes, a lot more new styles and patterns, fast fashion prints and new color palette. Weâ€™re pleased with that especially this spring.
In the back half youâ€™ll see a Wall Art reinvention thatâ€™s going to be mostly it will be assortment and operationally driven and easier way to shop for our customers, a cleaner way a layout for the store as well as seasonal with the back half reinvention.
So I would say the strategy remains the same its contribution remains consistent and we still see lots of opportunity not only this year, but in future years for reinvention.","2assistant

"Great, thank you very much for taking the questions. So a lot been asked, but we do have the ALS coming up in a few months here. And I wonder if you could just touch on maybe what some of the focuses that investors will see at the conference. I mean, I think about what's happened over the course of the last 12 months, you have acquired ortho sensor, you did touch on a little bit of the knee in a box and ASP knee opportunity there and then obviously robotics is getting a lot of attention in the ASPs in the outpatient setting. So maybe just that will set us on expectations into the conference?","Yes, listen, we don't have a big reveal at this conference. As you say we'll talk about the conformance product and we can talk about Triathlon AS-I, we have Mako, which is still going to be talked about quite a bit, especially with the new hip application that's starting to gain some steam, but still takes time to get that socialized more broadly. In addition to that, we have recent approval of the in space balloon for large rotator cuff repair within our sports medicine business, which is a very exciting product and a product used by sports medicine surgeons as well as the surgeons that do shoulder arthroplasty that come from Wright Medical. So that's also an exciting product, so as well as to perform Humeral product that Glenn mentioned earlier on with Wright Medical.

So a number of new products, but it's really, frankly, an exciting time to get back with our customers at scale, not having that conference last year was certainly a gap and really look forward to engaging with our customers once again. And so that's really what we're going to be showing. It's not something brand new that we're going to be unveiling, but really more of just continuing the momentum that we already have.","2assistant

"And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is this kind of new way of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you've done like -- can you just give us any kind of understanding, because one thing I'm noticing across the entire CPG landscape is companies are spending more money, but they're spending more money on the same message and in fact new consumers are being recruited, usage occasions are changing, and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers. And so, I find this Google partnership incredibly compelling for you guys. So, I'm just trying to get better context on how it's changing the return profile of your spend? If you can provide any context on that.","So, we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media. We always have, we've had strong media ROIs forever and our challenge is, how do we keep making them better and then we continuously optimize based on that. So right now, it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating and it is about making sure right now, I would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting and then once you have that target, the ability to alter the message.
So -- and then we alter our media mix accordingly. And I would say we see significant movement in that mix on a year-to-year basis, as we get better at that. I think we've raised some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons, whether it's S'mores by zip code or whether it's specific holidays and looking at sell-through at a store level basis to be able to dial-up media on a zip code level basis. So you'll continue to see more of that, frankly that's just becoming a way of how we operate now.","2assistant

" Hey, good afternoon you, all. And once again, I would echo the congratulations. It really is pretty fantastic. I have just a â€“ actually more of a few comments and most of my questions have been answered. But I get the impression honestly that the opportunity that you all have here is kind of huge. And my quick question is, did the Ebola crisis put you guys on the map? I know you guys have been around a long time. I understand that. But to the Ebola crisis really puts you on the forefront of kind of being kind of a brand name. And then I was also curious, are you working with any sort of consulting groups to keep your name out there and keep this momentum going, or do you not necessarily think that you even need to do that, I was just curious?"," On Ebola there is no question that our garments were featured on the cover of Time Magazine. I mean, another full Time magazine, it was the highlight spread the inside of our factory. So we got a lot of free what you might call free PR during Ebola. I mean after in bird flu, it wasnâ€™t mentioned the insiders will knew who we were. But the general public was pretty much kept in the dark, as to what went on in the bird flu in this country, but it was the largest avian flu influenza in the history of the United States, and youâ€™re going to barely hit the headline. As â€“ but on consulting groups, yes, we do employ consulting groups that are helping us in certain industries they live like the healthcare industry.

"Thank you, good morning everyone. I was wondering if you're already seeing some market share gain among suppliers. Are you realizing maybe more new authorization on product sales or are we still working on for now on the pruning phase, and maybe just sell more big products?","I'll only add really -- I you've heard Steve talk about our three priorities, commercial greatness, operational excellence, and one Univar. And the one Univar piece is something that we're really working on at the moment, because we're brining our teams together globally to share knowledge, share experience, share expertise on the products that they have, and the authorizations that they have. And we're able to act more as a global company, and share technology across the planet. And that's very attractive to some of the suppliers that we worked with. So we have got some new authorizations. We have some in Europe. We've actually jus won one in the U.S. this week. It's very early days for us in the U.S., but it's all about our win/loss ratio. Give the suppliers a compelling value proposition then they will come with us. And we're getting good feedback so far.","2assistant

"Okay. But I guess as you've probably going to gather -- you might have already gathered, I mean the results in the quarter of 36% was below the -- at least 40% guidance which you've reiterated several times this year. And I guess just try to again gauge this level of that that we can get back this distraction in the distributor side of your salesforce has been rectified and as you look into the third and fourth quarter, how do we get comfort as people on the outside that you can actually return to that level of growth? And the follow-on to that is given that this has now happened in this segment of our salesforce, how do you -- how does this not happen again? In a sense, how do you get these people perhaps more engaged or does this take you then having to perhaps go direct in more segments as opposed to relying on distributors?","Well, first off, I'll focus on the 80% of our revenue, which is really the direct channel. So, that's a portion of the business that we have clean and direct control over. And that's an increasing part of our business. Doesn't mean that we are going to be a hybrid model. The reason we think we want to be a hybrid model over the long-term is because their trauma is by design geographically spread out. And there are some selected trauma centers that are very good trauma centers, but they're geographically difficult to reach and maybe not concentrated enough. Examples are Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, parts of South Dakota. There are trauma centers in each of those locations, but no one of those in our current call pattern is probably large enough to put in a direct rep, at least at this point. And so what we're really doing is right-sizing what we consider to be some of our independent territories to say we definitely want strong partners in those locations. But in other areas where we may not be getting the focus, we're going to continue to divide out some of the territories and transition to direct reps. And you've seen us do that over time while the number of independent agencies has stayed about the same actually over the last year. The amount of trauma centers that they cover has actually gone down because we've been dividing out their territory and that's where some of the base has come for many of the direct reps that we've added. And that continues to be our strategy. You can see that we're planning to add some more reps over the rest of the year that will come from dividing either distributor or independent agencies territories or are direct territories. We still also plan to continue to split territories when they approach $2 million revenue number on any unrealized basis. We think that is where you might start to see some dampening of growth and that's obviously our goal is to continue to drive significant growth. And so we don't want to have that, so we set the expectation with our direct team and do execute such that we split territories when they are somewhere between a $1.5 million and $2.5 million. So, with all those things combined, I think we're in a good spot having addressed these. We won't eliminate all of our independent distributors, but we will be less reliant on that portion of the channel as we continue to grow.","2assistant

"So I guess I'll follow up on that last question just about the overall demand environment. Dara, you've been pretty forthright in your comment two years ago. I think you referred to the dog's breakfast. Is it the opposite of that now, whatever that is?","I wouldn't say that it's a cat's meow yet, but it's gone a lot better. I think that in general, demand has stabilized. In general, I would say we feel better, and I'd say the travel industry feels better than what we see in the overall economic numbers. We are seeing corporate travel coming back pretty nicely, both for us on a same-store basis and as far as signing up new clients. And we are seeing some tightness in occupancy and ADR strength in some of the metropolitan markets where you see a lot of business travel, in the New Yorks of the world, in Hong Kong, in Singapore, in London, et cetera. So I would say all of the signs that we see are pointing upward. Now I'll note that they are against very easy comps. And I think the comps are going to get harder as the year goes on. So I wouldn't declare all systems go yet, but I think the trends are good. And I think to the extent that we have a balanced business, a good, strong domestic business, a strong international business, a strong leisure business, a corporate business that's growing very, very quickly and on top of that, a terrific, terrific media business, I think we'll benefit from all those listings, so to speak.","2assistant

"And as a correlator to that, I guess. If you have sort of the seasonally strongest quarters in second, third -- second quarter and third quarter, but you're guiding for moving cash flow positive in fourth quarter. What's sort of the missing piece there? Is it just that you expect cost to be materially lower in fourth quarter, relative to as you move through the year and the cost sort of rolled over? Is that what it is?"," Well, I'm saying that there is actually a high amount -- a relatively high amount of drydocks that were scheduled for Q3, relative to Q4. So Q3 will be the top quarter for us from an operational-performance standpoint. But it won't be the top performance from a cash-flow standpoint because we've got a few drydocks scheduled in Q3. However, as I see in Q4, we don't have as many drydocks and running some of the benefit of what we see in Q3 into Q4.
And so I expect to be cash flow positive in Q4 for that reason.","2assistant

Good afternoon and congratulations. My question was on the resolution of the spring product issue. It seems like thatâ€™s clearly behind. But I was wondering if there was any impact whatsoever into the third quarter. And then how much chase or open-to-buy do you actually still have available to get to a higher comp similar to what you did in the third quarter? Thank you.,-,"0assistant

"Good, a couple of questions, first kind of around 2012, do you have any sense of what inventory strategies might be at the dealers and the retailers in the coming season?","When you say inventory strategies, as we have discussed, we think field inventory is in good shape, right. It's up a bit with snow but that's moving as we speak. And our focus, as we've talked many times, focus is on retail. If you take care of retail everything else takes care of itself. So, we wouldn't expect to see dealers on the Residential side or the Professional side try to drive a material change in their inventory levels. I mean, not sure they can; that was certainly an issue that we worked on as we put this working capital initiative in place through 2009, 2010. Now, it goes much farther, we won't have the inventory there to support the sales. So, no, weâ€™re in good shape there and we wouldnâ€™t expect to see any significant change there.","2assistant

In terms of fourth quarter, it will probably stabilize to maybe slightly higher, but we'll have to wait until -- to see.

"Thanks and good morning. On the gross margin, I know itâ€™s difficult, but can you ballpark what gross margin would have been excluding the currency benefits you got in the quarter. It would seem like they were squarely above 5% even excluding the currency benefit, and if thatâ€™s true, it would be the first time I think since 2005 where thatâ€™s the case. So can you confirm that and more importantly rank the key factors that helped gross margin performance. You threw a lot of variables out there but how much of it or I guess, in the order of priority it was customer mix, pricing, freight, vendor incentives and any other variable, you think were important?","Brian, this is Bob. If I think about the quarter, the thing that I like the best about it was our ability to execute in really kind of uncharted waters, that the teams had not been faced with the degree and severity of the FX buffeting that we got in Q3 and then their ability to map out a plan and recover much of that FX opportunity in the quarter, really speaks to our ability to set our sights on a goal and execute. And to do all of that in a slippery economic environment as well, really speaks to the quality of the management team on the ground and their ability to execute with our vendors and our customers. So, to kind of prioritize and size the elements of the gross margin improvement, itâ€™s a good exercise but really the exercise is our ability to execute in a tough environment and do it very well.","1assistant

"It's Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Not to sort of beat a dead horse here, but more interested in Steve's departure just in respect of what role did BC partners play, I guess,in the mutual decision? And then just a follow-up, what role would BC Partners play in the selection of the new CEO?","BC Partners is on the board. They had the same votes, if I might want to call it vote, because we never voted as such, as all the other board members. So they did not play any role other than as a board member. And they're good board members. This was not a BC Partners issue at all. In terms of the search process, there are five board members on the search committee and Jamie Rubin of BC Partners will be one of the five.","2assistant

Just another question on that difficult year ago comparison from the snow storms last year. Do you think the Michigan retail comp could be positive in the first quarter?,"We really havenâ€™t guided that. We indicated that Michigan was .9% for the year, that was the comps. We have also said that our comps are going to be slightly negative to slightly positive for the full year for the total retail enterprise. I would tell you that our expectation is that Michigan over performs that .9% comps in fiscal â€™15 and we think we can get better performance in the Michigan retail than last yearâ€™s .9%, yet weâ€™re cautious about guiding anything different than slightly negative to slightly positive for the entire retail base.","2assistant

" Hi, guys. I guess one follow up to the last question. So monthly volatility has certainly increased from a sales standpoint. If you go to April and May it was up in the lower 30 if you had in June deceleration, July was up 25% August, September then worse in October back up. I realize when you get the orders and when you ship the products that you canâ€™t fully control but is there something that youâ€™ve thought about or is there some way that we can sort of rationalize how the selling and sell through sort of work here. So thereâ€™s a bit of an explanation for the increased volatility because obviously the underlying sales per the scanner date are good but they ship way too much volatility here month-to-month. I guess any color there. And then the second question -- so you exhausted the share repurchase authorization. How you are thinking about the roughly $600 million in cash on the balance sheet right now?","We sell to distributors. You know what I mean.

"Great. Thank you so much. Michael, I wanted to just ask about wage inflation and SG&A leverage. It seems like the leverage point today, perhaps, starting in the third quarter, sits a little bit higher because of the wage increases. So Iâ€™m wondering if you can just talk to your -- what comp you need to leverage SG&A in a normal environment? And it seems like starting in the third quarter and continuing maybe through the first half of â€˜17 that comp needed is a bit higher because of the incremental wages, could you just talk us through that?","Sure, Kimberly. The third quarter levered by 5 basis points on the 7% comp. As we mentioned in our comments, that was partly driven by wages and that really hasnâ€™t changed from the first part of the year but it was also impacted by one-time non-recurring charges we took in the quarter. So Iâ€™d say the leverage point change in the quarter was those non-recurring costs. At this point, we continue to believe, at least in the next couple of years that the leverage point continues to be about 3%.","2assistant

Thatâ€™s helpful. And then I have a follow-up which relates to your inventory. You guys are quickly reducing your inventory to get to your goal of $1 billion reduction at retail.

"Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you're probably guiding it implicitly, call it, 800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that do you think is consoles versus non-consoles, because it's not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that's not that far off that number, which doesn't leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business.
So, is this just conservatism, or what else are you expecting here? How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus non-consoles?
","Well, I think, as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions, when I look at the full year at 28 to 30%, you know, sort of revenue growth, expect server to be significantly above that, and then, the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely. And so, you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business, as well as, you know, in the semi-custom business, and overall, we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year. So, it is not all console-weighted, if that's what you're asking.

"Yes. Okay. So we did not have a hangover effect in terms of product moving into the third quarter, and can you just clarify the second piece of question again?","I think on the second piece, just, I think, Iâ€™d just answer that already. We -- our business is all about chasing sales trends. So, Iâ€™ll remind you, coming into Q3 our guidance was a 1 to 2 comp in Q3 and we were able to chase it up to a 7%. So weâ€™ve been pretty good about our ability to go out and get merchandise in Q4 if the sales trend is there.","2assistant

"I guess, on that front, is the goal eventually to maybe to migrate completely to a digital model for USA TODAY? And then secondly, I guess, any thoughts on maybe a potential paywall on USATODAY.com?","I think I would reiterate what I said at the beginning, which is that we are going to follow consumers wherever they take us. What we're now seeing in these 4 pilots that we have done is that our customers in those markets love receiving additional USA TODAY content in their local newspaper. So there's -- I believe there's going -- for quite a period of time, there's going to be people who want to receive their content from USA TODAY in the print form, but more and more consumers are going to want to receive that content on their smartphones, on their iPads. We need to be wherever consumers want to be -- want to access that content. And we believe it will morph over time, but I don't think we're sitting here suggesting that digital-only is in the short term where we're going to be. And a paywall for USA TODAY, I will leave that to no current plans.","1assistant

"Now, that's fair. I guess maybe following up on a comment you made earlier about Asia Pac and the double-digit decline that you saw in China and Japan; can you give us any color on the verticals where you really saw weakness?","Well, the large project spending in China was definitely soft, at least - our billings to large projects in the first quarter was definitely soft. The economy over there still has a lot of activity, so it's not like it looks like its dead, but there was a lot of capacity put in place. So I think that's just going to be a little bit challenging here, as it really has been, for them to use up that capacity with more production before they really need to start putting more CapEx in place. Automotive sales over there are still okay, but they did build capacity to build a lot of vehicles. So we got to watch that. And ship building and aluminum profiles. And aluminum profiles are a big business for us and our powder business in China. And that is making trim and things that are used in the construction market. So as we see some domestic construction slowdown due to the big build in. In China that business is impacted as well. So yes, I think we just have to have a little bit of patience there. But again, we are anticipating overall in Asia Pacific that we are going to have a much better finish to the year than we had start and that we are going to put up a positive organic growth number.","2assistant

I just have one question on your aftermarket. I know this was a business that you guys have talked about when you were on the Bond Road Show [ph] in the fall. How is the growth in that business trending and what are your expectations for 2018?,"On the active market we see good trends going forward into the future based on just the amount of the equipment that came into the world in the early part of the decade; '10, '11, '12. Really put a lot of new equipment out there. Theyâ€™re running the equipment longer and harder. So for us we do believe aftermarket will continue to be an area of growth and opportunity. Weâ€™ve done a number of different measures that weâ€™ve talked about with pricing. We did that about a year and a half ago to make sure that weâ€™re priced properly within the market and got our products positioned where we want them to be. We have LSW which continues to be a good growth asset for us in the aftermarket. And really from a sales environment, we continue to just look at our sales force in our organization to make sure we got everybody out there hustling as hard as they possibly can to hit every potential customer. And I still see opportunities for us to continue to grow just from a sales organizational perspective in our dealer network and itâ€™s something we got some ideas on how we can continue to do that and weâ€™ve already launched some of those early this year. So broad-based speaking, I think the aftermarket will continue to be a positive growth engine for us. Clearly farmer incomes, the reports that weâ€™ve all seen coming out of the USDA are not headline wise, theyâ€™re not great obviously but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any reason for concern at this point that if farmer incomes are flat to down as they projected [Technical Difficulty] weâ€™re going to have to do some replacement and maintenance on that which is good for our aftermarket business.","2assistant

"Understood. Thank you for that. And then I guess thinking about the â€“ kind of as home price appreciation is starting to slow under rising affordability pressures, builders are losing their pricing power. So, how are you, I guess, keeping builders who are currently utilizing the manufactured products, I guess, away from switching back to cheaper stick framing under these new lower commodity prices?
","Well, most customers who use those products recognize the value in it and there's a lot of components to the value. Structurally, it's a better built house, less jobsite waste, increased cycle time. So you may have a few that try to shift, but I don't think the dip in commodity prices is really going to trigger that. During the depths of the downturn when framing labor costs hit rock bottom and commodity prices were down, that's where you'd seen builders more likely to re-evaluate the cost benefit. But I don't think we're anywhere near that right now.","2assistant

Just a follow-up on your customer conversations. For customers that might want to continue drilling are you guys having more discussions around different pricing models instead of maybe just seeing outright day rate cuts?," Yes. I think most people are looking at this straight up day work model Ryan when we talk to them. Like everybody, we've been interested. We've even had a couple of performance based contracts. We like it. Obviously, there's got to be some upside in the arrangement for us. But right now, I would suggest that most customers are looking at every way as possible to lower their cost. And I think more of them are focused on the day rate -- day work type model today.","2assistant

"Oh, that could be my assumption, I assume that or something. What were the maintenance contacts that were lost and what were the reasons.","Just attrition. We have attrition and we've had attrition through the years. Weâ€™ll have customers that will just no longer decide to pay maintenance because they really haven't had any maintenance issues quite frankly. Some of our OEM customers in particular that do not change bills that do not update because it's embedded in a device or in a particular product that almost like firmware that doesn't change will decide not to pay maintenance and it just really natural turnover and that's what we experienced. Some of it also is, as we move to SaaS, as you know, the line maintenance line will decrease as well just naturally over time. But there were no -- nothing material in the context of something to be alarmed about or anything that was unnatural. We didn't lose a customer, a large customer per se or anything like that or a large contract.","2assistant

"Yeah. Thanks guys. Just quick question, Suresh, on this commercial activity. You know if you look at the new customer adds in the quarter, they are still pretty strong and towards the high end of where you have executed over the last couple of years. So I guess the question is you know it still seemed like you executed at some level on the commercial business. What I am trying to solve for is what's underneath that miss executed. Because you added a lot of new logos in the quarter, was it just sort of follow-on business with the existing installed base of commercial accounts where you didn't have those investments to follow up on those accounts and drive incremental revenue?","Yeah. That's a good question. Let me start by saying our sort of land and expand model is as consistent as it's always been, so once we land a customer the pattern of repeat purchases as steady as ever. And you are right, that it was a quarter were customer acquisition was very strong. But what we had invested in was the larger deals which are not as much a reflection on customer count as much as deal sizes and really large deals. What we'd invested in was making that a larger part of our business. And so as that has pressure the number of new customers in the mid-size enterprise had to be even larger than we landed to make up for that shift in investment. So that's really what underpinned our results.","1assistant

"The weather headwinds that you mentioned had a lot of impact in December, I think you guys mentioned, but I just want to confirm do those weather comparisons improve since December or not necessarily?","First of all, is should have said this before I took the first question. I want to thank all the analysts for bearing with us going through this first year and all these adjustments and merger related. You read the script and itâ€™s hard to follow and I appreciate that and weâ€™re looking forward here to getting to a clean 2015 and having these numbers be a little easier to digest. The winter weather weâ€™re talking about really was about last year the state of Michigan had I think it was the number two all-time snow fall and we got plenty of snow storms and a lot of snow. West Michigan got 107 inches of snow, we normally get in the 70s range. When we started to cycle that in December, we started to see the comps fall off a little bit. We just couldnâ€™t get that pantry loading replaced with this yearâ€™s weather. In fact, in December we had 31 inches less snow than we had the prior year December and through the middle of February, December, January, and February weâ€™ve got 61 inches less snow than a year ago which almost is like the annual season snow fall. We were kind of like the opposite of Boston, theyâ€™re getting it this year, we got it last year. I hate talking about the weather as it relates to the sales, but when itâ€™s that significant it was clearly a contributor. We are seeing it moderating a little bit as we move through January and now into late February and early March.","2assistant

"It looks like you took the CapEx guidance up by about $50 million, so I was just curious what that related to, and then you also maintained your free cash flow guidance, so what the offset was there.","Sure. Thanks, Lorraine. The increase in CapEx versus the prior forecast relates to real estate and specifically, Victoria's Secret real estate. One aspect of it is some additional CapEx that will be on '13 books but relates to 2014 projects. The effect of that is greater this year than it normally is, but fundamentally, it's about real estate in Victoria's Secret. And again, we remain very bullish about those projects and the sales results we're getting and the profit results we're getting and the returns that we've generated for shareholders. So just some movement there. With respect to the free cash flow forecast, as you would imagine, there's a wide range of inputs there in terms of all the components of that and, again, remain comfortable with the broad range that we've given. As you appreciate, a lot of our cash is generated in the fourth quarter. And so there's a lot of moving parts there. But again, the business has very strong free cash flow properties, and there's a reasonable range of outcome there, but it will be a strong year for cash flow.","2assistant

"And Greg mentioned, Greg Levin, mentioned the testing on the third-party delivery, you know, trying some different things that maybe haven't had as much traction to date. Is that something that you're planning to continue or are there changes coming there as well to maybe improve that--","Thanks for asking that question, Nick, because this is -- obviously, in general, this growth in on-premise and third-party delivery is still new to everyone, right, including -- including ourselves although we were in there a little earlier than a number of folks. And it's -- it's changing rapidly just by virtue of its growth rate and we look at the promotion efficacy of some things that we ran a year ago versus today. There are a lot more competitors and attendees in the third-party delivery order platform. So when they're running and we're participating in certain promotions, it's -- it's more difficult to stand out and they're just not as incremental, frankly, as what they were even a year ago.So we're working with third-party partners and putting, you know, Kevin's teams creative hats on to look for ways where we can stand out and differentiate more than just the standard offers. And -- and, you know, it's going to take some -- some trial and error but I think we're not going to -- you know, we're not going to spend our way to buying sales at levels that we don't think really make margin sense either. So, if that's going to take some trial and error to -- to find that right balance and what we highlighted is -- that some of the softness that we're seeing, and this is national, that it is a slowdown. Now, when I say slowdown we're still in healthy double-digit growth rates here so, just be -- to be clear about that. But given the high growth rate that we've been seeing, part of the impact -- you know, it has impacted comps a bit when that rate has slowed down a bit as we've lapsed some of the offers of a year ago that worked really well.","1assistant

"That's helpful, Lisa. And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side, just with the workloads you're going after. But I'm kind of curious, you answered an earlier question saying you expect more GPUs for the data center. And I don't want you to pre-announce product, but then how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration? And just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA, how do I think about the investment there? Is this an area that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to, or how do I think about that over the next couple of years?","Yeah. So, I think that's actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center, you know, GPU market continues to be an important growth sector for us, and now, I call that over the several year horizon.
So, when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they're very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which are actually both the CPU and GPU win, and some of the optimization that we've done with that overall system. We think that there are additional opportunities like that, as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers, to optimize the machine learning frameworks.
And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond.

It still came in line with about 125, maybe a little bit more of hours per restaurant. At the same time, I think we were probably around 160 to 170 restaurants that got completed in Q2 with the remainder coming here in Q3 and when I think about that, 125 or so hours, it's not all one week and then it's done.

"Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Just for Wright Medical, you're saying you're confident that the combined business will grow at least 6% this year. Can you just speak to any more detail around sort of the recent drivers in this business? Are you guys seeing any benefit from dislocation associated with the recent impact of the spin off? And then, I guess, is there any reason why that 6% couldn't be 8% to 10% growth next year?","Yes, thanks, Kaila. What I'd tell you is we're really excited about the upper extremities business, it was growing very, very fast before, the acquisition that's continuing to really sing, especially in the United States. And we've just launched a new product, which will provide extra fuel to the fire. And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle was going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective, those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer and we knew that these countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride.

But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis, and we sort of moved it up to mid single and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be six plus percent for this year. And you should assume if this continues, and the elective procedures on the lower extremities ramps up that we should have a very good year next year. And also our core trauma business is actually having a very good year as well. So overall feeling very good about it. We're not going to give guidance for next year, but I think you can tell by our total network feeling very optimistic about the future of our trauma and extremities business.","2assistant

Joseph Munda - Sidoti & Company,"With the - what I can say about the process is yes, that article in December and for those investors that are not familiar with what Joe is talking about, there was an article, early part of December about positioned sort of walking throw in a very lenient interpretation of the Stark Law and how the use of IMRT centers etc, etc had prop cost. It cropped up at the expense of patients getting other choices for the treatment of cancer.

Now, all of that was shared and in, what it is doing with me right now is I am sort of putting together and amassing what may or may not be a campaign. If you remember Joe I had to get by the election to find out what was going to happen post-November.

Now that things are settling down, I am interested in seeing what kind of a vehicle, might- we have to put through another CMS push. I have not made the total decisions yet, what I can say is that article caused a stir and our sales force reported back that throughout the landscape in the US everybody saw it and everybody read it.

Now, have I seen anything if they, got an injunction to stop these folks? No, I have not seen that yet. What I continue to look for is the level playing field where comparative effectiveness and cost controls that I mentioned in the conference call, looking for avenues where this gets a stage in Washington, but right now Joe, there is a lot of clutter, we are trying to repeal healthcare reform and we have not had an opportunity to get voiced.","2assistant

"Thanks, good morning. Turning to the acquisition you just made, DI-NA-CAL, could you describe what acquisition moves if any you will be making? I mean this is just a U.S.-based business and you have a lot of facilities in the United States. And I think you mentioned in the press release a lot of business around Cincinnati where you are based. So what does the integration consist of?","We are pleased that DI-NA-CAL really only have two locations; here in Cincinnati and one in Greensboro, North Carolina. So we will review those locations and how we integrate those into our existing business, but unlike Europe where we inherited 12 locations, we have got that down to seven, we donâ€™t have anything like the operational heavy lifting with DI-NA-CAL that we did with York. So the integration is more around teams and who is going to be doing what going forward and who is going to be looking after which customers and obviously looking at our cost in general and our supply chain, but we donâ€™t see expensive heavy lifting as we have in the York case, but it will take us some months to work through getting the benefits that we see there.","2assistant

So, how are you, I guess, keeping builders who are currently utilizing the manufactured products, I guess, away from switching back to cheaper stick framing under these new lower commodity prices?

And are you confident that you can achieve your target sales goals for a lot of these new product launches? And then follow up questions just on liso-cel BLA submission. I was wondering if you can give any more specifics about the FDA request. Thank you.","Thank you, Terrance. Let me just start. I will ask Chris to comment on your question, and Nadim and also then Samit can follow up on liso-cel. We're taking a way clear approach with launches. And obviously, the number one priority is the health and safety of our employees of the healthcare professionals. So we donâ€™t want to disrupt healthcare systems, right now. And so we have taken the position to really maximize early on our remote capabilities in terms of engaging with our customers in order to respect to the challenges of the pandemic. Having said that, while we have global principles, those principles apply differently to different parts of the world. And they also apply to different brands, because the launch of a new indication for an existing well-established brands is clearly a different strategy versus a totally new medicine. So Chris and Nadim can give you a couple of examples of how these principles we are applying them to our launches and obviously the continued support of our portfolio.","2assistant

"And looking back at the strategic initiatives that you have for this upcoming year, I know you said it was about $25 million of capitalized costs associated with that. What do you expect the expense startup costs to be and the transition costs?","I don't have that broken out and some of that it's so embedded into some of our operating numbers that it's not as easy to separate as you might think because you have people that are running a distribution center, doing their day job and then they are also managing part of the planning for the upstream downstream. So at the end of the period, we see a little bit more pressure in certain areas, but we've provided for those from a budgeted perspective in the way that we built our numbers and the way we've built our plans for 2008 and I'll continue to emphasize that our commitment to the marketplace was to eke out a very small fractional hairline improvement in EBITDA rate while at the same time fully absorbing all of these strategic costs and our transition costs and we manage that as we go. I mean in some cases we don't always know what the costs is going to be but that's just management. Sometimes you have to manage one part of your business to offset something else and to make it all pull out the right way. We just fully understand that we've got to absorb those costs and we can't go backwards while we're doing this. We have to continue to go forward even if it's in teeny-tiny steps.","1assistant

"Great. And then just in terms of Wildcat, can you give us any early data in terms of how sell-through has gone? And ultimately, as I think about your guidance for next year, how significant is Wildcat in that guidance? Whatâ€™s sort of the year one assumptions there?","Yeah, we donâ€™t breakout individual data on individual models. So I canâ€™t give you a lot of detail there. The guidance that weâ€™ve provided on the ATV business, which includes side-by-sides as well of Wildcats, we said would be up anywhere from 26% to 32%; thatâ€™s over a year that we just completed. And so when we looked at the year we just completed, ATV sales were up 25%. So up 25% the year we just completed and next year weâ€™re saying 26% to 32%. So, overall, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s â€“ you can break them down into three buckets, but thereâ€™s no doubt that thatâ€™s having the biggest amount of impact of the three categories in our ATV business.
In terms of guidance, I think the guidance weâ€™ve provided takes into consideration â€“ the Wildcat sell-through has been going very well. But as we have mentioned before, our objective was not just take orders and ship the orders. We shipped the product. We took orders, we shipped some product and we wanted to see how retails were going and retails are going very well. So weâ€™ve continued to go ahead and ship.
You can see in terms of overall inventory, we continue to watch that very closely. And we donâ€™t want to go ahead and ship based on initial orders. Weâ€™d rather go ahead and see how the marketâ€™s reacting and then ship based on retails.","2assistant

How does Lakeland keep track of all the emergencies? You wake up and you turn on the news and thereâ€™s the crisis of the day that is what the company does. You respond to these crises. How does the company â€“ how are you aware or how are your people aware of what you should do to respond to these emergencies each day?," Well, usually the way it happens is there is an emergency and itâ€™s â€“ it involves somebody. If itâ€™s an oil-spill it involves the oil company. If itâ€™s a tank car spill, it involves the railroad. If itâ€™s a pandemic, it usually involves the hospitals. Those people who are directly affected usually or immediately call their safety distributor looking for equipment. And itâ€™s not just the protective apparel that we manufacture. We really stick to apparel, but theyâ€™ll call â€“ theyâ€™re looking for respirators to, so theyâ€™ll be on with the distributor looking for respirators and they might call 3M directly, because 3M is the biggest manufacturer of the respirator, so itâ€™s â€“ really they usually call us. Weâ€™ll see it on the nightly news, and then the next morning theyâ€™ll call us. But we usually hear it before the nightly news. So â€“ I mean thatâ€™s how we respond. We usually respond to the end-user customer directly or we respond to the distributor whoâ€™s being called by the end-user. And we keep inventory all over the world.","1assistant

"Got you. And then sorry, I didnâ€™t get the technical here, but just over 40% of the direct salesforce leaves a lot of room for what the actual number was. I was wondering if you might want to -- if you could kind of quantify we're talking 45, 50. Any color around how well the direct channel grew to give people comfort that 40% is the right number for the year.","Well, look I answered, we're continuing to grow low to mid 40s on the on the direct channel. And they're doing very, very well and what we're really encouraged with is the fact that these new reps as Karen had talked about are coming in with a good base of business and they're growing from that. And so we're seeing really strong initial productivity from our newer reps that we brought on and as they get through their third, six and nine months with the company. It gives us a lot of optimism as we look at the back half of the year.","2assistant

"Hello, thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, again, for the results and also for having the vision to grow your LNG portfolio back in 2018, '19, especially with the acquisition of U.S. LNG portfolio from Engie and Toshiba, at a time where those LNG contracts would have probably provided some losses. So I guess that was a countercyclical and wise strategy, in my view. But now I want to understand more your sensitivity to spot LNG prices. And I fully get that given the structure of your portfolio. You may have surely hedges in place. For 2022, if I understood well, during the presentation, you stated that a $10 per MBtu move equals to around $3 billion of additional cash flow, $2.2 billion for Upstream and $0.8 billion for LNG. And back in September, I reminded that you also highlighted that a $10 per MBtu move in both NBP and spot LNG, were adding $6 billion to your cash flow by 2025. Should I be right to understand the discrepancy of $3 billion between the 2 sensitivities because of the hedges you have? That is my first question.

And the second question is, should I also be right to assume that if you were to raise your medium-term assumption for both NBP and JKM, so spot LNG in Asia by $5 per MBtu. We could also add $3 billion of structural cash flow to your 2025 plan.","Technical questions. So first, yes, you are right on Toshiba just to tell you that today, we are cash positive after '21 without using the $800 million we received, it's a profitable business. So we have received $800 million and we are already making more money. So just thank you for reminding that to everybody. I would say then your point. There is a point, yes. We mentioned in September that when the difference between the JKM and Henry Hub is increasing by $1 per million BTU, then we have extra cash of, if I remember, $600 million. By the way, there is a lag effect there because, yes, it's linked to hedges all that. And so in fact, when you make the hedges the year where you make the hedges because it's a mark-to-market story, you are hedging the year after. So you have the results in the year and you have the cash flow in the year after, if I remember correctly. So you have a discrepancy between the results and the cash.

So in 2022, we'll get the results of the hedges which were implemented in 2021. But remember that the way we hedge is quarter after quarter. So we did a new in first quarter '21. But the last quarter, we should have waited for the long -- end of the year. Now we were not magicians. We would have done it. We would have waited but we don't -- do work like that. We hedge quarter after quarter. So in fact, what we embarked in the hedges which will be delivered in 2022, I would say, is only half a year compared to what you could imagine today, just to explain you that. And what we'll do this year, of course, we have today a spread between JKM and Henry Hub which must be around $15 or $20 per million Btu. This is the decisions that we will engage the hedges we will do in first quarter, for example. You will have some results but the cash will be in '23 which is good. That's good visibility.

So there is where it's not exactly to plan. So in a permanent regime, your assumption for 2025 is right. So $5 million BTU extra spread will give us in a permanent regime, $3 billion extra cash flow in 2025. It's more difficult to do from 1 year to another year because it depends, of course, it's a permanent regime but it means the $5 should be the same during -- the spread should be the same along the -- all the years along all the quarters as we, again, hedge quarter after quarter. I think I've been clear to you -- it took me a little time to understand. So I'm trying to translate all that in a -- and if not, you call Jean-Pierre and Stephane and they will explain you. But fundamentally, yes. The answer is, in '22, we'll receive more cash than '21 from these hedges because in '21, we see the 1 done in 2020, in '22, 2021. But '22 is not a full year, I would say, compared to what could be done '23. So is there something additional to come to us in terms of cash flow.","2assistant

"Thank you. David, I just had a couple of questions. I wanted to follow up on what you were just saying to Mark about security and analytics. Is there any data you could share with us thus far on what up-sell has looked like of those types of offerings? And how you see it kind of helping, I guess, ARPU, if you will, on a per customer basis? And then also, just in terms of the pace of conversions from the first licenses or the short-term capacity licenses that you guys had in the beginning of the year, when you're thinking about your forecast for calendar 2021, which you gave from a revenue perspective, how much does that play into it? And are there expectations that you can share with us about the conversions? Thank you.","Yes. I'd repeat something that Arlen said just a minute ago, and that was that we are running programs, of course, that will start the end of this year, but it's really more of a Q1, Q2 phenomenon. The intent there is to convert those licenses to SaaS. And so those would have less of a recognized revenue impact into 2021, but we certainly expect that we'll be able to convert a good portion of those, and that's just based on early conversations, customer usage data, et cetera. But again, because they're converting from what had been largely recognized upfront to a longer-term subscription, it's a relatively muted benefit that will just flow in over time.","2assistant

Looking at our fullyear fiscal 2008, utility market basically totaled around $172Â million in total revenues, industrial market segment is around $400Â million, traction power was just under $40Â million, were basically electrical power products of the $611.5Â million.

"You seem to be detailing the store [ph] with the underlying trends remain pretty positive. I guess, if you back out some of the puts and takes that happened over the course of a year, whether it's payment terms or duration, the underlying trends that you're still seeing suggest that Red Hat can sort of maintain mid-teens or better growth longer term certainly with the additions of some of these newer products here out in the future?","Well, first of all, we've only guided for the fiscal '14 year. We've not provided guidance beyond that. But one of the things I would point out to everybody, both in analyzing the fiscal '13 results and the fiscal '14 guidance, is the growth of subscriptions. It's high-teens growth in both years for growth of subscriptions. And we -- and that factors out even the currency impact of the yen for the fiscal '14 year. As we said last year, and I'll just reiterate, our strategy on services is to help us enable our customers to do what they want to do and basically, it's to sell subscriptions. So we have been working with our partners to try and -- try to enable more partners to be able to deliver the consulting so that we don't have to do it. It gives more feet on the street to help push subscription. So you should expect that the services business is going to continue to grow probably in the single-digits range for some time. It sort of masked the overall growth rate a little bit, more important part is the higher subscription growth rate.","1assistant

"Thanks for the question. I just had a couple, as a follow up for David if the environment normalizes this year, maybe still be a lower run rate for some of your new launches. Since if this affects how you think about 2021 in terms of revenue or cash flow, and other opportunities for synergies to be realized on an accelerated basis. And then Giovanni, big picture on the BD front. You talked about deals still being focused on as well integrate cells. And so just curious whether the COVID-19 environment offers this view either their priorities or perhaps the size and scope? Thank you.","So, thank you for the question. Particularly on guidance, as we're thinking about it, as we said is, right now we think the inventory build-up that came through is going to really sell mainly in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. As far as what we're watching closely for new patients starts in anticipation that that recovers in Q3 and we're back to normal in Q4. And as well as the infusion centers in the volumes returning to normal. And that would continue into 2021 on. What I would say is that the underlying performance of the business is very strong in the first quarter. And as you heard about what the product launches are confidence in those four product launches are coming this year, as well as the product launches next year. That gives us the confidence in reiterating our guidance for both this year and next year, but we're going to keep a very close eye on the macroeconomic factors that could wind up impacting entire industry as I talked about in my remarks. As far as the synergies, we continually review those synergies both internally as well as with our board. We are really pleased with the progress we've been making on the synergy front. And the progress with the third party vendors has done very, very well. And as far as getting the organization in place, the vast majority of our placements of the organization are done. And as far as site selection is concerned bringing our sites together that's moving along as planned as well. So we remain confident in delivering kind of essential targets that we have.","2assistant

"Just on the AnGes front, since we were discussing the approval with Japan. Is there any update on the Japanese study starting up?","No, as we have said previously that they are waiting the outcome of the approval in Japan before embarking in that study because obviously that will be a pivotal point for them to even raise some more money for funding that study.

They have sufficient cash to start the study, but they want to raise more money to get the study to its completion. So, I think those events are both tied from a science perspective as well as from a financial perspective.","2assistant

"And then secondly, you guys again, reported a pretty significant outgrowth in your single family volumes relative to the single family housing starts. I would just be curious if you guys have any final thoughts points on that? Just, how do you think you're actually comparing versus your own markets? You could look at different data points of completion data probably held up a little better in Q2. So, what do you guys see as a sustainable share gain at this point, as the market recovers? And what kind of metrics are you looking at to kind of determine your market outperformance?","So, I'll let Chad comment more broadly, but specifically to some of the details, I think we do see share gains for the business. We mentioned that we have some particular strength on the east coast. I think we were also advantage of this by some of the markets that were most negatively impacted with starts being areas where we don't play a ton of big chunks California for example. But even in the markets where there has been some decay, we have still seen some sharp growth. And I think that Chad hit on a couple of the points as to why, I mean we are a reliable provider, we are a trusted partner for our home builder and customers, and we performed well. But more broadly, I would say that, that east of the Mississippi for us this year has definitely been going to strength where we've seen the biggest share gains and the biggest successes.","2assistant

"Hi. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the U.S. retail profit performance. Specifically, Don, I wanted to ask -- you cited here unfavorable price realization mix and lower volumes as the contributing factors to the $155 million decline. Notably absent in these comments is comments about gross inflation and/or productivity savings in the quarter. Can you talk about this a little bit? Obviously it must've been positive, but I'm curious about magnitude of it and the pacing of these programs throughout the year?","David, as we -- as John reiterated today, we still expect 3% inflation for the year. We think it's fairly evenly distributed during the year, so we don't necessarily see any unique quarterly facing. HMM, our productivity savings from HMM are similar. So one of the reasons that we remain confident in guiding to a higher gross margin is because with inflation at 3% and HMM productivity savings over $400 million, we look at that as a net offset at least and part of that came through in the first quarter which is why it really wasnâ€™t a contributing factor year-over-year.","2assistant

"David, can you maybe go through the gross margin side a little bit more both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis just sort of how much did mix and, say, the efficiencies and sort of the product and services cost reductions that you're seeing contribute to the gross margin improvement just in a little more detail?","Sure, Scott. Year-on-year, the big driver is our product margins. Basically, VMware product margins improved and storage product margin improved, and the storage product margins are from 2 things. One is from a continued mix shift towards our higher margin products, which is our software products and our appliances, and we've kind of promoted that theme for the last kind of couple of years. That helps us. But we also got some margin rate improvements in almost all the major products on a year-on-year basis as well. Quarter-on-quarter, we saw a little bit of improvements in product gross margins, but the bigger improvement quarter-on-quarter was in services gross margin where a couple of things happened. We saw a mixed shift towards our maintenance services which are more profitable than our professional services. But also within our professional services, we also saw a few points of margin improvement there, and those are the biggest drivers.","2assistant

"Thanks a lot. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple of questions here. In terms of the â€“ assuming that Verizon starts coming back as you'd previously answered in the question, what type of revenue base do you think we should be at the end of the year in terms of breakdown in telco, cable and satellite? Is cable going to be bigger than the telco side, or is the telco going to be bigger than the cable by the end of next year?","Yes. I know it's â€“ we really don't kind of break things down like that and we really don't want to provide guidance beyond the current quarter. I would say generally, if you look historically when Verizon was our only deployment of MoCA, they represented north of 70% of the overall revenue of the company. As we kind of moved into this Q4 period, they lost than half of that in terms of our overall revenue. And I think even with the spring back in Verizon, the other businesses are going to be growing at a more rapid clip. So the Verizon component of our overall business is maybe a third of our business and decreasing from there. I think the satellite opportunity and the cable opportunity each are as big as the Verizon deployment over time. So, we should see pretty uniform distribution and diversification of our revenue across the MoCA business, while at the same time, we are also seeing pretty substantial growth in our non-MoCA produce lines as well. So I think generally, we are going to see continued diversification of the revenue stream across multiple service providers and multiple products.","2assistant

"No that's great. Just my follow-up. As we think about 2020, are there any network changes you want to -- you need to call out just so that we're aware of? Or is it clear?","It's pretty clear. I mean, I think there's been â€“ obviouslym there's been the conversation high over the weekend, which we were aware of a few weeks ago. Disappointed that CareSource have taken this decision but recognize that's their decision to take. But we are -- have got other games to make that up in other networks. So we think it's pretty balanced over the year and we're very confident in our ability to grow the market in 2020.","2assistant

"Okay. And I am sorry if you've said this and I missed it, but in terms of the total CapEx outlook for 2014, in terms of the dollars and then kind of will there be additional kind of catch-up investment needed in 2015 to kind of address the problems that you have in terms of M&A -- integrating the M&A acquisition there?","The capital we are spending is less about integrating the M&A. We are going to spend about $20 million in 2014. The majority of that is being spent in one facility, to increase capacity, reduce costs and that's going to be very helpful. Going forward as we look out to 2015 and thereafter, our CapEx would probably come down a couple of million dollars to $17 million to $18 million a year. So we don't need to expand the capital spending, we will actually reduce it going forward.","2assistant

And then just on Florida and California. I think California was the big turn. Could you just talk a little bit what you're seeing in California from the delivery side and also the retail side that suggests that sequential improvement relative to Q2?,"I'll take the retail piece and let Steve address BSD. I still think and if you look at California and Florida for the Retail business, it's roughly 25% of our fleet of stores. If you look at unemployment in California and Florida, it's still running about 24% or more, higher than the national average. I think the stores in California are well known. There's still a furlough that I think is in place in public government there. So I don't think California is out of the wood. That being said, for Retail in the third quarter, students and parents don't need to do back-to-school shopping. They still need the supplies to allow their students to go back-to-school equipped. And we did I think a good job, not only advertising the products that we had available for sale. We have attractive price points. And we were fortunate that when shoppers came in our stores, we were able to convert them to buyers. So we're pleased with the results in California. I think, we said they were slightly positive for the quarter. I don't know that, that's necessarily a telltale sign of what to expect in the future. I think, they've got a lot of headwind that they're going to have to navigate through.","2assistant

"Got it. And then on the second part when you talk about shifting investment from commercial enterprises on performance. I missed this in the past, but what exactly did you stop investing on the commercial side that's hurting you and what exactly investing to help you?

","There are really three changes that impacted us. One is when we look at a mix of teams that we brought on board, over half of the teams in the last four quarters have been non-commercial teams named account teams. So number of sales teams we are adding is lower in the commercial segment than traditionally has been. That is the first thing. The second one which has even more short-term impact is we have a lot of marketing programs, channel programs aimed at opportunity generation and these are fairly short-cycle opportunity generation. Typically 75 to 90 days cycles in which they convert and so we pull investments from both marketing and channel or shifted investments toward larger enterprise wins rather than commercial wins. Both of those investments that we intend to grow back and add again in our business model.","2assistant

"Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, gentlemen. Patrick, you mentioned about Suriname that you may be able to identify the oil development by the end of the year. So what exactly we have to do in order for us to reach that space? How far we are from reaching that kind of decision? And the second point is that on -- second question, on the LNG sales mix that the page in your presentation, it looked like about 40%, 45% of the sales is in spot. So we assume that volume is totally linked to the spot LNG price or that they are still, to a large part, linked to the long-term oil prices.","So Suriname is just drilling. We need to appraise. We have several discoveries. We have a plan. I think we have 1, 2, 3 wells to drill in order to confirm. I mean, we have 3 -- next 3 wells on the self-run pole where we have many different discoveries. I think with the 3 wells we will comfort us capacity to -- again, you know the point is that we are targeting enough oil pool to avoid -- to have -- to find a solution for commercialization of the gas which might be tricky and delay everything. So there are 3 wells for me coming and we intend to drill them, all of them by '22. So I think it's why I was answering end of '22 I hope we'll have high things plan. And I would say, the self-run pole because then we explore on the north as well of the block. But where we have made discoveries mainly on the southern part of the block. For me, after these 3 wells, we have a clarity of what can be done and the size of it engaging towards development. So that's the point where I am today. If I had to explain you all details, it could take 2 hours because there are plenty of cases, assumptions, etcetera. So we need to drill. Second and we find hydrocarbon [indiscernible] don't worry. But the question is of which oil, of which gas, etcetera.

So on the other part, yes, you are right. It's a 60% long-term and 40% spot. Spot is pure spot. I mean spot is 2 things, in fact. In the spot volume, you have 10 million tons, let's say, as a round figure which is 20% is old deals [ph] which are spot deals which means we have the vessels, we have the LNG tankers and we buy spot and we sell spot and we make small money on the difference between buying arbitrating. But it's a pure spot. And then in our portfolio of the marketing team, there are contracts which are linked to spot indicator, I would say, either JKM or NBP. And these ones are not oil linked. If they oil linked, they are more in the long-term part. I'm speaking under the eyes of Stephane. If I made a mistake, you raise your -- it's okay? It's okay. So the answer is right. That's my answer.","2assistant

"Hi. Thanks. On COVID-19 collection kits, can you just talk about what you're hearing from customers in terms of near and long-term demand for their tests? I think, given your fourth quarter guidance, it would suggest that demand is pretty strong, at least in the near term. But I would just be interested in any other color there.","Jacob, I would say that, we are approaching a point where we will sell everything we can make and the capacity increases that we forecasted back in August will serve us well. And so, we are seeing a rather insatiable demand for our products for molecular testing that we believe will continue, certainly, through 2021 and probably well into 2022. It began certainly in North America and in the U.S., but we're looking outside the U.S. as well right now. So these are great discussions to have, because I think people have really gravitated to the fact that you need saliva and self-collection saliva as a key part of testing.","2assistant

"Makes sense. And then Stephen if we look at the balance sheet you guys have $260 million of cash. You've done a number of smaller deals here one divestiture. You're clearly spending right now to build out manufacturing, but curious how if at all your M&A appetite has evolved over the last few months. And if anything in the funnel is perhaps more actionable today than it was coming into this year. Thanks.","Yeah. We continue to look for attractive opportunities to leverage our balance sheet. I think that our business circumstances have certainly changed with the COVID-19 opportunities. And it remains our objective to look at acquiring companies products technologies that are accretive to our overall growth strategy. But as we look ahead to 2021 and 2022, the growth is going to be, I think, fairly enormous at current course and speed. And so we'll be adjusting our expectations of business development and the size and types of deals accordingly. But the pipeline has been robust, I think, as you suggested both with our own outreach and inbound interest from potential prospects, and we'll continue to look at that. Our balance sheet, I think is stellar. No debt at all on the balance sheet. And I think that will lead us to some interesting opportunities in the very near future.","2assistant

"Joe and David, on VNX, relative to the 1,300 new customers that you've noted for VNXe, what were the comparable number be if you were to just look at VNX? And in terms of share gains in the midrange, specifically for VNX and Isilon, can you share some thoughts on where you think the share gains for each of these product families is coming from?","Let me do it this way. I don't want to break out -- break apart VNX and VNXe. But the risk of David throwing something at me, I'll evoke executive privilege here, and I'll give you a number you would -- but it's like I don't -- we're going to basically -- we're focused on mid-tier and that's the number we're going to give you, but I'll delve back. Year-on-year, our VNX products grew over 20% year-on-year. And so in other words, if you took Celerra, CLARiiON last year and you took those same product families this year with VNX, VNXe, we grew over 20%. So the family is doing fine. We're having applicability across a wide, probably all verticals and in several big cloud topology. So we're very pleased with the way the VNX Family is progressing.","2assistant

"Got you. Thank you. That's very helpful. And just a follow-on to that question, I think earlier in the call you mentioned something about sort of three months to stabilize. What's the puts and takes that might affect that three months to, I don't know, be four months or two months or whatnot?","Yes. And so then I just want to clarify what that means in terms of stabilization. I think what John was talking about is the team that works on this project would like to move on to the next implementation. And we talk about this being our last major implementation and it is, because with this deployment, we will virtually have almost all of our manufacturing worldwide on SAP and what's left are sales operations that will roll out over time. But we would want to get the team quickly not needed anymore for the transition so that they can move on to the next implementation, which under the accounting terms means all that labor is capitalized instead of expensed. And that's kind of the risk to the P&L and the assumptions in the P&L. In terms of overall business stabilization, I think we've said in the past that that really takes almost a full year before people get really proficient of using SAP and taking advantage of SAP. And so, some of these redundancies that we have in head count and what we call backfill in the business, et cetera, they'll stay throughout much of 2017 to make sure that not only is the system working well, but people know how to take advantage of it. And we've talked about when we really start to see the benefit coming back to us is after that one-year anniversary or the second half of 2018.","2assistant

I mean is Crenlo operating any better now than it was when you put it into dis ops [ph]?","Yes, it is. And Crenlo going to be a low double digit margin business, at least that's about where it's at.

" Okay, thank you. And then I have a question with regard to printing trends, because youâ€™ve heard â€“ itâ€™s a big discussion among investors and even within some of the companies clearly of what type off end use people are seeing on the devices.
Again, if you can kind of net out the impact from the earthquake especially domestically, just are you seeing pressure from tablets? Are you seeing pressure from more and more documents just being viewed on screen? I think any color you can provide us would be very helpful because again itâ€™s a question that comes up often. Thank you."," Okay, answering your question, the print volume is concerned, itâ€™s usually sales volume itself will be decreasing. But even in Japan, after the earthquake, the total print volumes stopped increasing. So generally speaking, the worldwide, the order â€“ print volumes with â€“ keep increasing. Usually, the risks print volumes is but the total, the information, the volumes of the information keep increasing. So still the total print volumes never decreased, still keep increasing that is worldwide. Is that a complete answer?","2assistant

"When you talk about the acquisition environment out there, I know you said that there is nothing to announce right now but I've always kind of viewed that to get to that 4% EBITDA margin you'll likely have to make an acquisition in the distribution space. Are there more conversations going on or is it still very similar to how it was last year that people are looking at from the other distribution companies that are bought whether it be the performance food groups or US Food Services and just looking for too much money at this point?","I would say that I don't know that there has been a 180-degree turn. What I would say from conversations is that I think that there is a much more of a realization of the difficulty in the credit markets these days. And that you've got a lot of people that have recently made large deals so they are sitting on the sidelines and you have got others, private equity that is not able to perhaps be as active as they have been in the past.

So what I am seeing is, is that if you are a Nash Finch and you have got a strong balance sheet and strong access to capital and a solid performing business, you are probably a pretty rarity right now and you are probably a good dance partner. So I am not having as many people -- last year all I heard about was the US Food Service deal. I couldn't get past hello without hearing about the US Food Service deal and I am not having that happen. I think business people by in large are pretty astute and they see the markets and they see what's going on out there and they realize that if they need an exit strategy or they desire an exit strategy, there's not as many people out there today as there perhaps was a year ago and that's causing discussions to be a bit more reasonable.

Having said that, I want to emphasize that we don't have anything that is underway or imminent or anything that we are even close to pursuing, but we continue as we have mentioned in the past to discuss opportunities with a variety of parties that we think would make sense for both of us.","2assistant

Based on the current kind of calendar that we are looking at from an approval standpoint, I think we will know a whole lot more if they're going to really going to go rush [ph] on this until latter part of 2010.","2assistant

" Okay. And considering that your big order that -- for like the shipments have been likely to be later, isn't it fundamentally different than whether Apple and Qualcomm go with the one set of foundries or the other? And therefore, do you have some contingency plans on what might happen if there are cancellations?","Yes, we're heavily engaged with the management team and have had a lot of meetings about support. So I'm confident as well that there is -- to Bren's point, that these orders are very solid. I think one thing we have seen in the recent past as the customer has consolidated more, we do see, I think, we have pretty good visibility into people's confidence in their plans. And usually, they'll let us know if it's not going to happen. But once they place the orders, it's pretty good indication. The only exception would have been what happened during the 2009, right after the financial crisis, I'd say then, in those environments, all bets are off. But since then, I think it's been very solid.

"Okay. And then if I look at the cash deployment, there's about, what, $20, $21.50 of cash in the balance sheet. And I know you've been repurchasing shares, and you have a nice generous dividend policy. But as I kind of look at repurchasing as we go forward, in your thought process, I mean, are you guys concerned at all about the float that's outstanding and the availability of shares? And kind of -- are you going to continue to buy in to that or buy back stock into that if the opportunity presents itself? Or have you considered other cash deployment options?
","Well, I think -- obviously, we do -- we are aware of the float issue and the conversation there and balancing that impact, but we do have a matrix in place that establishes what amount we purchase at which price levels from that standpoint. It's been a challenge for several years. It's a great challenge to have. But I mean, there's only so many places we can go with the cash. As Chuck said earlier, we remain strongly interested in inorganic activity. And with the BOT conversation and the leasing conversation, it's nice to have the cash available if those opportunities truly make sense for us to get involved in.
